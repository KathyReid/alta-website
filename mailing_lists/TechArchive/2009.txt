			      CALL  FOR  PAPERS
			      ==================

				 PACLING2009

     Conference of the Pacific Association for Computational Linguistics

			     September 1-4, 2009
		     Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan
	       http://sig.media.eng.hokudai.ac.jp/pacling2009/


SCOPE

Pacling2009 is a low profile, high-quality and workshop-oriented conference whose aim is to 
promote friendly scientific interaction relating to computational linguistics among Pacific 
Rim countries.  The emphasis of the conference is on interdisciplinary scientific exchange 
demonstrating openness towards high-quality research falling outside current dominant 
?schools of thought?, and on technological transfer within the Pacific region.  The 
conference represents a unique forum for scientific and technological exchange, being smaller 
than ACL and COLING, and more regional with extensive representation from the Pacific.


TOPICS

Substantial, original, and unpublished research is welcome on any topics in computational 
linguistics, including, but not limited to, the following:

 * Phonology and Phonetics
 * Morphology and Morphological Analysis
 * Syntax and Syntactic Analysis
 * Semantics and Semantic Analysis
 * Pragmatics and Discourse Analysis
 * Spoken Language and Dialogue
 * Corpora and Corpus-based Language Processing
 * Text and Message Understanding
 * Text and Message Generation
 * Machine Translation
 * Text Summarization
 * Information Extraction and Text Mining
 * Information Retrieval and Question-Answering
 * Language Learning
 * Natural Language Interfaces
 * Electronic Dictionaries, Thesauri and Ontology
 * Semantic Web
 * Semantic Computation

In addition to these topics on general computational linguistics, Pacling2009 will also have 
a workshop to discuss the challenging theme below:

         Language and Human Mind.

This theme covers research areas of modeling a human mind in terms of natural, efficient and 
sympathetic communication between humans and computers, i.e. user-model-based communication 
systems, emotional and affective expressions comprehension, understanding of other person?s 
mind, etc.


SUBMISSION OF PAPERS

Authors should prepare anonymous submissions, in English, of up to 6 pages including 
references.  Guidelines and style sheets (based on the ACL styles) are available at the web 
site:
    http://sig.media.eng.hokudai.ac.jp/pacling2009/

Papers that are being submitted to other conferences, whether verbatim or in essence must 
declare this fact. If a paper appears at another conference, it must be withdrawn from 
PACLING2009. Papers that violate these requirements are subject to rejection without review.
All papers will be submitted electronically in PDF format, through a web-based submission 
system. The link to the submission web site will be soon made available on the web site.


PUBLICATIONS

All accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings in paper and in CD-ROM.

			 First Call for Participation

				       
			      EACL 2009 Workshop
				    on the
			     Interaction between
		  Linguistics and Computational Linguistics:
			Virtuous, Vicious or Vacuous?


				March 30, 2009

				Athens, Greece

		 http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/~tim/events/eacl2009/


We are delighted to announce this unique event, bringing together a formidable
group of invited speakers and panelists to explore the interaction between
linguistics and computational linguistics. Join us to reflect on the past,
present and future of the linguistics--computational linguistics interface,
and explore the nature of the relationship between the two fields: virtuous,
vicious or vacuous.


Invited Speakers:

  Mark Johnson (Brown University, USA)
  Frank Keller (University of Edinburgh, UK)
  Mark Liberman (University of Pennsylvania, USA)
  Stelios Piperidis (Institute for Language and Speech Processing, Greece)
  Geoffrey Pullum (University of Edinburgh, UK)

Panelists:

  Emily Bender (University of Washington, USA)
  Gregor Erbach (European Union)
  Bob Moore (Microsoft Research, USA)
  Gertjan van Noord (University of Groningen, Netherlands)
  Hans Uszkoreit (Saarland University, Germany)



Overview:

This workshop is an attempt to bring together linguists and computational
linguists across the broad spectrum of the two fields who operate across or
near the computational "divide", to reflect on the relationship between the
two fields, including the following questions:

  * What contributions has computational linguistics made to linguistics, and
    vice versa?

  * What are examples of success/failure of marrying linguistics and
    computational linguistics, and what can we learn from them?

  * How can we better facilitate the virtuous cycle between computational
    linguistics and linguistics?

  * Is modern-day computational linguistics relevant to current-day
    linguistics, and vice versa? If not, should it be made more relevant, and
    how?

  * What do computational and core linguistics stand to gain from greater
    cross-awareness between the two fields?

  * What untapped areas/aspects of linguistics are ripe for
    cross-fertilisation with computational linguistics, and vice versa?

On the basis of exploring answers to these and other questions, the workshop
aims to explore possible trajectories for linguistics and computational
linguistics, in terms of both concrete low-level tasks and high-level
aspirations/synergies.


Background:

In its infancy, computational linguistics drew heavily on theoretical
linguistics. There have been numerous examples of co-development successes
between computational and theoretical linguistics over the years
(e.g. syntactic theories, discourse processing and language resource
development), and significant crossover with other areas of linguistics such
as psycholinguistics and corpus linguistics.

Throughout the history of the field, however, there has always been a subset
of computational linguistics which has openly distanced itself from
theoretical linguistics, perhaps most famously in the field of machine
translation (MT) where there is relatively little in the majority of
"successful" MT systems that a core linguist would identify with. In the
current climate of hard-core empiricism within computational linguistics it is
appropriate to reflect on where we have come from and where we are headed
relative to the various other fields of linguistics. As part of this
reflection, it is timely to look beyond theoretical linguistics to the various
other fields of linguistics which have traditionally received less exposure in
computational linguistics, including sociolinguistics, historical linguistics,
neurolinguistics and evolutionary linguistics.  


Target Audience:

The workshop is intended to be of interest to both the large numbers of people
interested in deep linguistic processing (e.g. grammar developers,
computational syntacticians, computational semanticists, researchers working
on parsing and generation, and researchers applying deep linguistic processing
in various application areas), but also those who have perhaps explicitly
distanced themselves from linguistics, or who come from a linguistic
background but have moved away from it in their computational linguist
research. We also strongly encourage (pure) linguists to come along.

Multiword Expressions: Identification, Interpretation, Disambiguation
and Applications (MWE 2009)
Workshop at the ACL/IJCNLP 2009 Conference (Singapore), 06 August 2009

The workshop is endorsed by the ACL Special Interest Group on the
Lexicon (SIGLEX)

The link to MWE 2009 is the following:
http://multiword.sourceforge.net/PHITE.php?sitesig=CONF&page=CONF_40_MWE_2009___lb__ACL__rb__

A short description of the workshop, the topics as well as submission
information, important dates and the members of the Programme
Committee are presented below.

Description

       Multi-Word Expressions (MWEs) are an indispensable part of
natural languages and appear steadily on a daily basis, both new and
already existing but paraphrased. Thus, the automated processing of
MWEs is important for many natural language applications. The meaning
of MWEs can be either motivated or arbitrary. Native speakers master
most MWEs, while learners of a foreign language have to learn MWEs by
heart. The interpretation of MWEs poses a major challenge for
automated analysis helping both groups easily master MWEs.

       The growing interest in MWEs in the NLP community has led to
many specialized workshops held every year since 2001 in conjunction
with ACL, EACL and LREC; there have been also two recent special
issues on MWEs published by leading journals: the International
Journal of Language Resources and Evaluation, and the Journal of
Computer Speech and Language.

       As a result of the overall progress in the field, the time has
come to move from basic preliminary research to actual applications in
real-world NLP tasks. Following this trend, the LREC-MWE'08 focused on
gathering resources and creating a common repository in order to rank
MWE candidates and facilitate further research.

Call for papers

       In MWE'09 we are interested in the overall process of dealing
with MWEs, asking for original research related (but not limited) to
the following four fundamental topics.

       Workshop topics

             (1) Identification. Identification is a major problem for
MWEs. The MWE identification task is to determine whether a MWE is
used non-compositionally (figuratively) or compositionally (literally)
in a particular context. The identification of MWEs by automated means
is a difficult task, as it does not suffice to store the MWE into a
dictionary database. Rule-based (morphosyntactic rules) and/or
statistical approaches may be needed to identify MWEs in context.

             (2) Interpretation. Semantic interpretation of MWEs,
particularly noun compounds and determinerless prepositional phrases,
is the task of determining the implicit semantic relation holding
between the MWE's sub-components. This specific area is inviting
research on (linguistically) identifying the semantic relations (SRs)
and automatic SR interpretation in MWEs. The relation inventories used
can be of different granularity and dependent on the particular type
of MWE construction. In some cases, MWE's semantics can be also
specified in terms of a suitable paraphrase.

             (3) Disambiguation. Disambiguation (Semantic
classification) is the task of specifying the semantics of MWEs based
on an inventory of semantic relations. It tends to presuppose the
ability to classify the (degree of) compositionality of MWEs and
applies only to compositional MWEs. The aim is to specify the
semantics of MWEs in terms of predefined semantic categories, e.g., in
WordNet.

             (4) Applications. Identifying MWEs in context and
understanding their syntax and semantics is important for many natural
language applications, including but not limited to question
answering, machine translation, information retrieval, information
extraction, and textual entailment. Still, despite the growing
research interest, there are not enough successful applications in
real NLP problems, which we believe is the key for the advancement of
the field.

       Submission information

             Submissions must describe substantial, original, and
unpublished work. Submissions will be judged on correctness,
originality, technical strength, significance and relevance to the
conference, and interest to the attendees. Full papers may consist of
up to eight (8) pages in total (references icluded) and will be
presented orally. The deadline for paper submission is May 1, 2009
(GMT + 8).
             The official style files for ACL/IJCNLP 2009 are
available at: http://www.acl-ijcnlp-2009.org/main/authors/stylefiles/.
The workshop submissions should use the same formatting guidelines.

       Format

             Full paper submissions should follow the two-column
format of ACL-IJCNLP 2009 proceedings without exceeding eight (8)
pages including references. We strongly recommend the use of ACL LaTeX
style files or Microsoft Word Style files tailored for this year's
conference, which will be available on the conference website. All
submissions must conform to the official ACL-IJCNLP 2009 style
guidelines to be announced in the conference website and they must be
electronic in PDF.
             As the reviewing will be blind, the paper must not
include the authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore,
self-references that reveal the author's identity, e.g., "We
previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...", must be avoided. Instead, use
citations such as "Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...". Papers
that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without
review.

Dear Colleague:

We woud appreciate if you could participate and if you could send this call as appropriate.

Thanks and kind regards
Cecile Paris

*************************************************************

Dear colleagues,

We are currently conducting a study on the use of health related social networking sites. These sites are designed to bring together users with various health concerns so that they can interact with each other for mutual benefit. We hope to gain some insight into how these sites are used, who uses them, what is useful about them as well as what might make them more useful.

If you are someone who has a serious or chronic medical condition (e.g. illness, injury, mental condition, etc.) OR you are a close friend or family member of someone who fits this description we would like to invite you to participate in this online survey.
If you can think of anyone else who might fit the criteria, please pass this on to them as well.

You can access the survey from: http://rosella.wirrapoi.com/limesurvey/index.php?sid=81638&newtest=Y
The survey is already active and will be closed in a week's time on the 1st of February.
It is likely to take you at most 20min to complete.
If you have any questions please contact Melody Wang (Melody.Wang at csiro.au<mailto:Melody.Wang at csiro.au>)

Many thanks for your time,
Melody Wang

Call for Papers

The 1st International Workshop on
Emails in e-Commerce and Enterprise Contexts (E3C)

Held at the 11th IEEE Conference on Commerce and Enterprise Computing
(CEC 2009)

July 20th -23rd, 2009
Vienna, Austria

Workshop web site:
http://www.infosys.tuwien.ac.at/autocompwiki/index.php/E3C
Conference web site: http://cec2009.isis.tuwien.ac.at/


Important Dates:
----------------
* Full paper submission: March 15th, 2009
* Authors Notification: April 15th, 2009
* Camera ready versions due: May 15th, 2009
* Workshop: July 20, 2009


Scope
-----
Despite the rise of competing technologies, email remains a crucial
business communication tool and an important source of enterprise
information and knowledge. According to recent surveys, (i) information
workers spend an average of 20% of their time dealing with email, and
(ii) about 80% of users prefer email as a business communication tool.
In Europe, about 98.8% of enterprises are SMEs (Small and Medium
Enterprises). With an average of 7 employees per SME, email is widely
used by SMEs to manage tasks and cooperation in conducting their
business. Web 2.0 and e-commerce systems also rely on email for
notifying users about transactions, changes, services or events.

Email is used for many functions, including alerting, archiving, task
management, collaboration and interoperability. Partly due to this
diversity of use, email is rarely a standalone information source. Email
messages often contain pointers to files (e.g., saved attachments),
links to resources and services on the Web, and references to other
people. Email communication also interconnects business transactions
with human communication, collaboration and interaction, thus providing
a rich source of information for social and business-oriented computing.

Existing email research has focused largely on topics such as
understanding social aspects of email, email task management and user
interaction with email. There has been little interaction between email
research and work on enterprise computing which considers information
from various legacy systems, business Web services, business process
templates and documents.To effectively exploit the capability of email
in e-commerce and enterprise contexts, in particular for SMEs, we
foresee the need to join efforts from these different research
communities to identify issues and share research results.

The aim of this workshop is to gather email and enterprise computing
researchers and practitioners to discuss and propose solutions for email
in e-commerce and enterprise contexts.

E3C would like to build on previous successful events such as the
Workshop on Enhanced Messaging (EMAIL-2008) at AAAI-08.


Research Topics
---------------
* Architecture for enterprise cooperation and
   interoperability over email
* Intelligent email for SMEs
* Email-based business task and process management
* Email content analysis, message summarization, information extraction
* Semantic Email and Semantic Knowledge Extraction
* Email social networks for enterprise computing
* Email analysis of exchanged documents
   for semantic alignment via negotiation
* Email Workflow Management for Business Processes
* Interconnection of email content and enterprise resources
   (legacy systems, document repositories)
* Enterprise resource mashup support for business email
* Approaches for email visualization and
   user interfaces in business contexts
* Case studies
* Business email datasets


Workshop Format
---------------
We seek original research papers and demos in the workshop:

Original research papers: we seek full papers (maximum of 8 pages in
IEEE CS style). Full papers should contain original contributions not
published or submitted elsewhere, and references to related
state-of-the-art work. Each paper will be reviewed by a minimum of three
reviewers.

Demos: The workshop also aims at having demo submissions demonstrating
the usefulness of email-based technologies for SMEs. Demo papers will be
limited to 2 pages in IEEE CS style.

Panel discussion and invited talk: we plan to have a panel to discuss
the topics of the workshop. In particular, we are seeking discussion to
understand the current status and future research on the combination of
social aspects and enterprise computing based on email. Pending
appropriate funding, we also plan to have an invited talk.

The workshop proceedings will be published by IEEE CS, following the
general rules of the CEC 2009.

*PhD 'Topic and Speaker Tracking in Broadcast Archives' (1.0 fte)*





*Faculty of Arts*

*Vacancy number: 23.08.09*

*Extended closing date: 8 March 2009*



*Job description*

In the project BATS (Topic and Speaker Tracking in Broadcast Archives) we
have an opening for a PhD position in audio mining and spoken document
retrieval.  The project aims at making it possible to search in audio/visual
archives, as is currently possible in searching for written documents on the
web.  The approach is to use speech technology tools such as speech and
speaker recognition to automatically transcribe and label the data in the
archives, and then apply text retrieval techniques to disclose the archive.
The doctoral research will focus on two techniques: topic detection, based
on speech recognition and word spotting techniques; and speaker detection,
based on a combination of the voice characteristics of the speaker and the
contents of the speech.  Apart from working on state-of-the-art technology,
the research will involve development and assessment of a prototype search
environment, with a focus on iterative, or refined, search strategies.  The
project will be carried out in close collaboration with the Catholic
University of Leuven (Prof. H. Van hamme). The PhD thesis will consist of a
collection of journal papers about the research subjects mentioned above.



*Requirements*:

The successful candidate must have a strong background in computer science,
pattern recognition and/or signal processing. In addition, he/she must have
an interest in human factors issues and user interface design. Good
communication skills in English are essential, as well as a good record of
collaboration in teams. Candidates must be authorized to work in the EU.



*Organization*

The Faculty of Arts consists of eleven departments in the area of language
and culture, history, history of arts, linguistics and business
communication, which together cater for about 2,700 students and collaborate
closely in teaching and research. The PhD student will work in an inspiring
environment as a member of an international and interdisciplinary team with
representatives from the universities of Nijmegen and Leuven as well as the
Flemish Broadcast Organisation, which offers excellent career perspectives
in academia and industry.



*Conditions of employment*

The total duration of the contract is 3.5 years. The PhD student will
receive an initial contract for the duration of 18 months with the
possibility of prolongation for another 2 years.



Informal inquiries should be made to Prof Dr David van Leeuwen (*T* +31
(0)346 356235; *E* d.vanleeuwen at let.ru.nl) or prof. dr Lou Boves (*T* +31
(0)24 361 2902; *E* L.Boves at let.ru.nl).



*Additional information*

The starting gross salary is ? 2.000 per month based on a full-time
employment.

Preferable starting date: April 2008.



An elaborate description of the project plan (in Dutch) or a summary
description (in English) can be obtained upon request. Please ask Hella
Jooren (h.jooren at let.ru.nl).





*Application letters, including extensive CV and MA thesis and the names of
at least two references, *(with vacancy number: 23.08.09, preferably by
e-mail) *can be sent to:*



Radboud University Nijmegen, Faculty of Arts,

		    Fourth Workshop of the HCSNet

	   Next-Generation Search Technology Priority Area

	 http://www.hcsnet.edu.au/priorityareas/nextgensearch


Date:	   16-17 April 2009
Location:  Jembi-Rinjah Eco-Lodge, Blue Mountains, NSW

Contact:   Diego Molla,	Diego.Molla-Aliod at mq.edu.au
	   Robert Dale,	Robert.Dale at mq.edu.au


CALL FOR EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST AND ABSTRACTS


Search for information is an ever increasingly important and complex
task. The first retrieval systems effectively treated documents as
bags of words, and this is still the main approach in current
systems. Yet the human processing of information makes use of a much
deeper understanding of text than these systems exhibit. Is there a
way to combine the computing power of machines with the sophisticated
processing of humans? In addition, there has been an explosion of
information available digitally in a wide range of media including
audio and video. How can we extend current technology to find
information in all available media?

This workshop is fourth in a series that aims to strengthen
collaboration among researchers and developers in all areas related to
search technology. In this last year of HCSNet funding support, we
would like to place the emphasis in this workshop on 'where next?'.
Accordingly, the event will take place in a secluded location in the
Blue Mountains, providing scope for uninterrupted discussions and
contemplation.  We particularly welcome submissions which sketch
personal views of where research in search should go in the coming
years, and how interdisciplinary approaches to research might
encourage developments.

The workshop will run from the afternoon of the first day to noon of
the second day, and there will be evening activities to complement the
day presentations.


AUDIENCE

The goal of the workshop is to gather people from all areas of
research, development and industry. We welcome people from academia
and industry with interest in any area related to innovative methods
for search, including but not limited to the following:

    * Cognitive Science
    * Natural language Processing and Language Technology
    * Information Retrieval
    * Human-computer Interaction
    * Data Mining
    * Formal Syntax and Morphology
    * Formal Semantics
    * Conversational and Discourse Analysis
    * Philosophy of Language


WORKSHOP FORMAT

The workshop will consist of a number of presentations during the day
and special activities during the evening. The day presentations will
be:

    * 20-minute presentations that describe a new project or specific
      idea to be shared with the community, with the aim of fomenting
      discussion; and

    * 2-minute poster boosters for those bringing a poster.

As evening activities we envisage group activities and discussion
sessions.

SUBMISSIONS

We plan to bundle accommodation and venue and we need an accurate
estimate of the number of people who plan to attend. We therefore ask
those interested in participating to email diego.molla-aliod at mq.edu.au
indicating the names of people who plan to attend BY MONDAY 2 MARCH
FEBRUARY.

In addition, submit a brief abstract of 100-150 words in length and a
paragraph with research interests BY THURSDAY 5 MARCH. Please send the
submissions by using the submission form at the workshop webpage (link
at the top of this call).


FUNDING

HCSNet will fund accommodation and train fare from Sydney to
BlackHeath for all participants. In addition, HCSNet fill fund $300
towards the cost of the air ticket for a number of participants from
outside the Sydney area. The provision of a submission as described
above is a prerequisite for funding. If not all participants can be
covered, funding grants may be allocated based on the relevance of
your abstract to the workshop theme; also, students and early career
researchers (in HCSNet terms, those who have received their PhDs in
the last fifteen years) will have priority.

Note that, although attendance at the workshop is free, membership of
HCSNet and registration for this workshop are required in advance of
the event.

Since we intend to book out the entire lodge, it is possible that
there may be space available for family and friends; if you are
interested in this possibility please let the organisers know as soon
as possible. Note that accommodation and travel costs for those who
are not taking part in the workshop cannot be covered.

NEW: We are pleased to announce that the workshop will be webcast live on the
day. We will post technical details on the website closer to the date of the
workshop.



Deadline for pre-registration: March 23, 2009 (http://www.eacl2009.gr/conference/registration)



We are delighted to announce this unique event, bringing together a formidable
group of invited speakers and panelists to explore the interaction between
linguistics and computational linguistics. Join us to reflect on the past,
present and future of the linguistics--computational linguistics interface,
and explore the nature of the relationship between the two fields: virtuous,
vicious or vacuous.


Invited Speakers:

  Mark Johnson (Brown University, USA)
  Frank Keller (University of Edinburgh, UK)
  Mark Liberman (University of Pennsylvania, USA)
  Stelios Piperidis (Institute for Language and Speech Processing, Greece)
  Geoffrey Pullum (University of Edinburgh, UK)

Panelists:

  Emily Bender (University of Washington, USA)
  Gregor Erbach (European Union)
  Bob Moore (Microsoft Research, USA)
  Gertjan van Noord (University of Groningen, Netherlands)
  Hans Uszkoreit (Saarland University, Germany)


The programme for the workshop and talk titles have now been finalised, and
are detailed on the workshop web page.


Overview:

This workshop is an attempt to bring together linguists and computational
linguists across the broad spectrum of the two fields who operate across or
near the computational "divide", to reflect on the relationship between the
two fields, including the following questions:

  * What contributions has computational linguistics made to linguistics, and
    vice versa?

  * What are examples of success/failure of marrying linguistics and
    computational linguistics, and what can we learn from them?

  * How can we better facilitate the virtuous cycle between computational
    linguistics and linguistics?

  * Is modern-day computational linguistics relevant to current-day
    linguistics, and vice versa? If not, should it be made more relevant, and
    how?

  * What do computational and core linguistics stand to gain from greater
    cross-awareness between the two fields?

  * What untapped areas/aspects of linguistics are ripe for
    cross-fertilisation with computational linguistics, and vice versa?

On the basis of exploring answers to these and other questions, the workshop
aims to explore possible trajectories for linguistics and computational
linguistics, in terms of both concrete low-level tasks and high-level
aspirations/synergies.


Background:

In its infancy, computational linguistics drew heavily on theoretical
linguistics. There have been numerous examples of co-development successes
between computational and theoretical linguistics over the years
(e.g. syntactic theories, discourse processing and language resource
development), and significant crossover with other areas of linguistics such
as psycholinguistics and corpus linguistics.

Throughout the history of the field, however, there has always been a subset
of computational linguistics which has openly distanced itself from
theoretical linguistics, perhaps most famously in the field of machine
translation (MT) where there is relatively little in the majority of
"successful" MT systems that a core linguist would identify with. In the
current climate of hard-core empiricism within computational linguistics it is
appropriate to reflect on where we have come from and where we are headed
relative to the various other fields of linguistics. As part of this
reflection, it is timely to look beyond theoretical linguistics to the various
other fields of linguistics which have traditionally received less exposure in
computational linguistics, including sociolinguistics, historical linguistics,
neurolinguistics and evolutionary linguistics.  


Target Audience:

The workshop is intended to be of interest to both the large numbers of people
interested in deep linguistic processing (e.g. grammar developers,
computational syntacticians, computational semanticists, researchers working
on parsing and generation, and researchers applying deep linguistic processing
in various application areas), but also those who have perhaps explicitly
distanced themselves from linguistics, or who come from a linguistic
background but have moved away from it in their computational linguist
research. We also strongly encourage (pure) linguists to come along.


Workshop Organisers:

  Timothy Baldwin (University of Melbourne)
  Valia Kordoni (DFKI and Saarland University)

The workshop is endorsed by the Erasmus Mundus European Masters Program in
Language and Communication Technologies (LCT).

HCSNet Hands-on Workshop on Mashups for Human Communication Science

		27-28 July 2009, Macquarie University

	     http://www.hcsnet.edu.au/workshops/mashups09


A Joint Workshop between the HCSNet Priority Areas of:

  - Next-Generation Search Technology

  - Effective Interfaces


CALL FOR ABSTRACTS

Mashups are all about presenting information from various sources in
an integrated Web application. While early experiments with
multimedia-multiweb application integration were done by savvy
programmers who would effectively decode yet unpublished APIs of
applications such as Google Maps, currently there is a wide range of
software platforms for the development of mashups, and building a
mashup is becoming increasingly easier by everyone. In this hands-on
workshop, experts from leading mash-up development technologies will
introduce their products and then groups will be formed to build
mash-ups on the spot. Emphasis will be given to mashups related to
HCSNet's Priority Areas.


KEYNOTE PRESENTATIONS

There will be presentations by the following people:

* Amanda Millar, coordinator of Yahoo! 7 Australia Open Sessions;

* Pamela Fox, from the Google Geo APIs team; and

* James Hogan, from Queensland University of Technology.


AUDIENCE

The goal of the workshop is to introduce mashup technology to all
people interested in using it for topics related with any of HCSNet's
Priority Areas. We welcome people from academia and industry with
interest in any of those areas:

 - Speech

 - Effective Interfaces

 - Next-Generation Search Technology

 - Human Communication Disorders

 - Perception and Action

This workshop is especially suited for students, researchers and
developers who want to apply this new technology to their projects.


WORKSHOP FORMAT

The workshop will run over two days. The central component of the
workshop will take place in PC labs with all the software required to
build mashups, and with technical assistance. There will be extensive
tutorials and presentations by experts in mashups, and the workshop
will conclude with presentations of the mashups built over the two
days.


SUBMISSIONS

Submit a brief abstract of 100-150 words in length indicating the
reasons why you are interested in participating in this workshop and a
topic on which you would like to develop a mashup, and a paragraph
with research interests BY MONDAY 15 JUNE. Please send the submissions
by using the submission form at the workshop webpage (see the link at
the top of this call)


FUNDING

HCSNet will fund travel and accommodation to a maximum of $500 for a
number of participants from outside the Sydney area. The provision of
a submission as described above is a prerequisite for funding. If not
all participants can be covered, funding grants may be allocated based
on the relevance of your abstract to the workshop; also, early career
researchers (in HCSNet terms, those who have received their PhDs in
the last fifteen years) will have priority.

In addition, 10 student travel awards will be available for
postgraduate students outside the Sydney area.

Note that, although attendance at the workshop is free, prior
registrations to HCSNet and this workshop are required.

Undergraduate and postgraduate students from Macquarie University can
attend the workshop without prior registration to HCSNet and they must
register to the workshop using a separate registration process (TBA).


IMPORTANT DATES

    * Submission of Abstracts: 15 June 2009
    * Notification of Awards:  22 June 2009
    * Registration:            13 July 2009

HCSNet Workshop on Social Technologies Applications for Health and Medicine
Thurs/Friday, August 20-21 2009, Melbourne (Australia)
http://www.hcsnet.edu.au/node/3103
                             
Call for Submissions and Participation
 
Description
 
A great deal of research supports the belief that social interactions affect 
people?s health in various ways. Online communities have added a relatively 
new dimension to the lives of many people. This workshop aims to bring together 
a group of researchers and practitioners from medical, social and information 
technology communities to understand how social technologies might be used to 
support health and health initiatives: e.g. supporting people, their families 
and their communities in managing health; building and supporting communities 
of health workers and medical practitioners for improved communication and 
information sharing; allowing communities of health stakeholders (policy makers, 
practitioners, the public) to develop effective health-related policies and 
initiatives.
 
We intend this workshop to be a place to foster communication across the 
relevant disciplines in order to design and develop effective tools and user 
experience  to support online health communities.
 
This workshop will be held close (in time) to CollabTech 2009 (The Fifth 
International Conference on Collaboration Technologies 2009), which is being 
held in Sydney, August 12-14, 2009 (http://www.collabtech.org/).   This will 
provide opportunities for participants (especially from overseas) to attend 
both events to exchange ideas and experiences.  
Audience
We hope to attract a multidisciplinary range of researchers and practitioners 
from the medical, social and information technology communities working in 
areas such as health, social science, and online communities related to health.
 
Issues of interest may include:
* support for patients vs. support for carers
* tools for developing online communities
* designing effective user experience for online patient communities
* strategies for building online health communities and developing long-term 
engagement
* motivating information-sharing, content development, and contribution to policy
* health education and policy development: developing trusted content
* tailoring health information
* methods/techniques to provide motivational support
* trust, ethics, and related issues in online health-related communities
 
Event Format
 
The workshop will be held over two days, on Thursday August 20th and 
Friday August 21st, 2009, in the Melbourne area (precise location to be determined).
The workshop will include invited speakers (including a HCSNet-supported 
international presenter), presentations from participants and interested parties, 
workshopping and development of ideas, and plenty of time for discussion.  
Submission instructions are given below.
 
Event Outcomes
 
We hope the workshop will help the community to build a collective 
understanding about online health and medical communities: from the health 
perspective, what support can a social network provide; from the social 
network community, how can they provide that support; overall, how can 
such systems be deployed, evaluated and adopted. We also hope that the 
workshop will build bridges across the communities (health and social 
networks), and even generate a sustained interest and community around this 
area. We envisage this workshop to be the first of a series.
 
Submission Format
 
Interested participants are invited to submit a position statements 
(about 300 words) describing their interest in the area of health/medical 
online communities, along with a short biography.
 
Submission is via the online submission page: 
http://www.hcsnet.edu.au/node/add/submission/3103.
 
Note that to make a submission (or to qualify for free attendance) you need to 
sign up to the HCSNet community 2 months before the event (it?s free!); you can 
register for HCSNet at (http://www.hcsnet.edu.au/user/register).
 
Submissions deadline:  10th July, 2009
 
Publication
 
Submitted abstracts will be published online and also distributed to participants. 
We are planning to solicit long articles after the workshop to capture the work in 
workshop proceedings.
 
Registration Information
 
Registration for the workshop is free for HCSNet members that have signed up to HCSNet 
2 months in advance of the event. For non-HCSNet members registration is $50 per day. 
For members and non-members please follow the link below to register once registration 
has opened.
 
Registration deadline: Friday 31st July 2009
 
Travel Grants
 
HCSNet will fund a number of travel grants to help cover the costs of travel and 
accommodation for participants from outside the Melbourne area. HCSNet has also 
approved a Student Support Grant to enable students to participate. The provision of 
a submission as described above is a prerequisite for funding. If not all participants 
can be covered, funding grants will be allocated based on the relevance of your abstract 
to the workshop theme; also, students and early career researchers (in HCSNet terms,
those who have received their PhDs in the last fifteen years) will have priority.

 HCSNet Hands-on Workshop on Mashups for Human Communication Science

		27-28 July 2009, Macquarie University

	     http://www.hcsnet.edu.au/workshops/mashups09


A Joint Workshop between the HCSNet Priority Areas of:

  - Next-Generation Search Technology

  - Effective Interfaces


CALL FOR ABSTRACTS

Mashups are all about presenting information from various sources in
an integrated Web application. While early experiments with
multimedia-multiweb application integration were done by savvy
programmers who would effectively decode yet unpublished APIs of
applications such as Google Maps, currently there is a wide range of
software platforms for the development of mashups, and building a
mashup is becoming increasingly easier by everyone. In this hands-on
workshop, experts from leading mash-up development technologies will
introduce their products and then groups will be formed to build
mash-ups on the spot. Emphasis will be given to mashups related to
HCSNet's Priority Areas.


KEYNOTE PRESENTATIONS

There will be presentations by the following people:

 * Neil Wilkinson, Technical Director at Yahoo! 7
   o An intro to Yahoo!'s Open Strategy - focus on YQL (Yahoo! Query
     Language)

 * Pamela Fox, Developer Programs Engineer for the Google Maps API
   o Creating Maps Mashups: From Data to Map

 * James Hogan, Associate Professor of Computer Science at Queensland
University of Technology
   o Making Mashups for Data Intensive Research


AUDIENCE

The goal of the workshop is to introduce mashup technology to all
people interested in using it for topics related with any of HCSNet's
Priority Areas. We welcome people from academia and industry with
interest in any of those areas:

 - Speech

 - Effective Interfaces

 - Next-Generation Search Technology

 - Human Communication Disorders

 - Perception and Action

This workshop is especially suited for students, researchers and
developers who want to apply this new technology to their projects.


WORKSHOP FORMAT

The workshop will run over two days. The central component of the
workshop will take place in PC labs with all the software required to
build mashups, and with technical assistance. There will be extensive
tutorials and presentations by experts in mashups, and the workshop
will conclude with presentations of the mashups built over the two
days.


SUBMISSIONS

Submit a brief abstract of 100-150 words in length indicating the
reasons why you are interested in participating in this workshop and a
topic on which you would like to develop a mashup, and a paragraph
with research interests BY MONDAY 15 JUNE. Please send the submissions
by using the submission form at the workshop webpage (see the link at
the top of this call)


FUNDING

HCSNet will fund travel and accommodation to a maximum of $500 for a
number of participants from outside the Sydney area. The provision of
a submission as described above is a prerequisite for funding. If not
all participants can be covered, funding grants may be allocated based
on the relevance of your abstract to the workshop; also, early career
researchers (in HCSNet terms, those who have received their PhDs in
the last fifteen years) will have priority.

In addition, 10 student travel awards will be available for
postgraduate students outside the Sydney area.

Note that, although attendance at the workshop is free, prior
registrations to HCSNet and this workshop are required.

Undergraduate and postgraduate students from Macquarie University can
attend the workshop without prior registration to HCSNet and they must
register to the workshop using a separate registration process (TBA).


IMPORTANT DATES

    * Submission of Abstracts: 15 June 2009
    * Notification of Awards:  22 June 2009
    * Registration:            13 July 2009
    * Workshop:                27-28 July 2009

Abstract

2008 saw the launching of the "Australian National Corpus Initiative". Linguists and language technologists from around Australia committed themselves to a sustained push for the creation of a major addition to Australia's research infrastructure in the humanities and social sciences, namely, a massive online database of spoken and written language in Australia, in all its forms and diversity and over time (Burridge, Haugh, Mulder and Peters forthcoming). One potential challenge to such an endeavour arises from the fact that a massive online source of language data already exists, namely the World Wide Web. In this talk I first consider why Web as Corpus cannot be seen as an adequate substitute for a national corpus. I then discuss the relative merits of Web as Corpus versus the creation of Specialised Web Corpora, and the relative potential of each to contribute to the future Australian National Corpus. I next outline two case studies investigating the relative utility of Web as Corpus versus Specialised Web Corpora in studies of specific pragmatic phenomena, namely im/politeness in emails between academics and students (Haugh forthcoming a), and "taking the piss" in everyday interaction amongst Australians (Haugh forthcoming b). I conclude by briefly discussing the implications of the various types of data considered in this talk for the ways in which such data is ingested and searched in the future Australian National Corpus.


Short resume

Michael Haugh is a lecturer in the School of Languages and Linguistics at Griffith University. His main area of research is linguistics pragmatics where he has been focusing on various speech practices (for example, implying, teasing, complimenting) and their relationship to face and politeness in a number of languages, including Japanese, English and (Taiwanese) Chinese.

 HCSNet Hands-on Workshop on Mashups for Human Communication Science

		27-28 July 2009, Macquarie University

	     http://www.hcsnet.edu.au/workshops/mashups09


A Joint Workshop between the HCSNet Priority Areas of:

  - Next-Generation Search Technology

  - Effective Interfaces


CALL FOR ABSTRACTS (Extended date of submission)

Mashups are all about presenting information from various sources in
an integrated Web application. While early experiments with
multimedia-multiweb application integration were done by savvy
programmers who would effectively decode yet unpublished APIs of
applications such as Google Maps, currently there is a wide range of
software platforms for the development of mashups, and building a
mashup is becoming increasingly easier by everyone. In this hands-on
workshop, experts from leading mash-up development technologies will
introduce their products and then groups will be formed to build
mash-ups on the spot. Emphasis will be given to mashups related to
HCSNet's Priority Areas.


KEYNOTE PRESENTATIONS

There will be presentations by the following people:

 * Neil Wilkinson, Technical Director at Yahoo! 7
   o An intro to Yahoo!'s Open Strategy - focus on YQL (Yahoo! Query
     Language)

 * Pamela Fox, Developer Programs Engineer for the Google Maps API
   o Creating Maps Mashups: From Data to Map

 * James Hogan, from Queensland University of Technology
   o Making Mashups for Data Intensive Research


AUDIENCE

The goal of the workshop is to introduce mashup technology to all
people interested in using it for topics related with any of HCSNet's
Priority Areas. We welcome people from academia and industry with
interest in any of those areas:

 - Speech

 - Effective Interfaces

 - Next-Generation Search Technology

 - Human Communication Disorders

 - Perception and Action

This workshop is especially suited for students, researchers and
developers who want to apply this new technology to their projects.


WORKSHOP FORMAT

The workshop will run over two days. The central component of the
workshop will take place in PC labs with all the software required to
build mashups, and with technical assistance. There will be extensive
tutorials and presentations by experts in mashups, and the workshop
will conclude with presentations of the mashups built over the two
days.


SUBMISSIONS

Submit a brief abstract of 100-150 words in length indicating the
reasons why you are interested in participating in this workshop and a
topic on which you would like to develop a mashup, and a paragraph
with research interests BY MONDAY 22 JUNE (extended from 15
June). Please send the submissions by using the submission form at the
workshop webpage (see the link at the top of this call)


FUNDING

HCSNet will fund travel and accommodation to a maximum of $500 for a
number of participants from outside the Sydney area. The provision of
a submission as described above is a prerequisite for funding. If not
all participants can be covered, funding grants may be allocated based
on the relevance of your abstract to the workshop; also, early career
researchers (in HCSNet terms, those who have received their PhDs in
the last fifteen years) will have priority.

In addition, 10 student travel awards will be available for
postgraduate students outside the Sydney area.

Note that, although attendance at the workshop is free, prior
registrations to HCSNet and this workshop are required.

Undergraduate and postgraduate students from Macquarie University can
attend the workshop without prior registration to HCSNet and they must
register to the workshop using a separate registration process
detailed in http://www.hcsnet.edu.au/workshops/mashups09mq

	     http://www.hcsnet.edu.au/workshops/mashups09

A Joint Workshop of the HCSNet Next-Generation Search and Effective
Interfaces Priority Areas

CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

Mashups are web pages or applications that combine data or
functionality from two or more external sources to create a new
service. Mashups are all about easy, fast integration, frequently
using open APIs and data sources to produce results that were not the
original reason for producing the raw source data. An example of a
mashup is the use of cartographic data from Google Maps to add
location information to real estate data, creating a new and distinct
Web service that was not originally provided by either source.

In this hands-on tutorial, experts from Google and Yahoo! will
introduce their mashup development technologies; participants will
then immediately put this knowledge to use building their own mashups.
This is a unique opportunity to learn how to use cutting edge web
technologies from those who know the tools inside out.

PRESENTERS

There will be tutorial presentations by the following experts:

* Neil Wilkinson, Technical Director at Yahoo! 7
* Pamela Fox, Developer Programs Engineer for the Google Maps API
* James Hogan, from Queensland University of Technology

INTENDED AUDIENCE

The goal of the workshop is to introduce mashup technology to all
those interested in using it. The workshop is especially suited for
students, researchers and developers who want to apply this new
technology in their projects. Familiarity with a programming language
like Java or JavaScript is recommended.


WORKSHOP FORMAT

The workshop will run over two days. The central component of the
workshop will take place in PC labs with all the software required to
build mashups, and with technical assistance. The event will conclude
with presentations of the mashups built over the two days.


REGISTRATION

Submit your registration information using the registration form at
the workshop webpage (see the link at the top of this
call). Attendance to the workshop is free, but places are
limited. Registrations will be processing on a first-come,
first-served basis until all places are taken.

Undergraduate and postgraduate students from Macquarie University can
attend the workshop using a separate registration process detailed at

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
July 9, 2009


PRESIDENT HONORS OUTSTANDING EARLY-CAREER SCIENTISTS

President Obama today named 100 beginning researchers as recipients of  
the Presidential Early Career Awards for Scientists and Engineers, the  
highest honor bestowed by the United States government on young  
professionals in the early stages of their independent research  
careers.  The recipient scientists and engineers will receive their  
awards in the Fall at a White House ceremony.

The Presidential Early Career Awards embody the high priority the  
Administration places on producing outstanding scientists and  
engineers to advance the nation's goals and contribute to all sectors  
of the economy.  Nine Federal departments and agencies join together  
annually to nominate the most meritorious young scientists and  
engineers-researchers whose early accomplishments show the greatest  
promise for strengthening America's leadership in science and  
technology and contributing to the awarding agencies' missions.


"These extraordinarily gifted young scientists and engineers represent  
the best in our country," President Obama said.  "With their talent,  
creativity, and dedication, I am confident that they will lead their  
fields in new breakthroughs and discoveries and help us use science  
and technology to lift up our nation and our world."

The awards, established by President Clinton in February 1996, are  
coordinated by the Office of Science and Technology Policy within the  
Executive Office of the President. Awardees are selected on the basis  
of two criteria: Pursuit of innovative research at the frontiers of  
science and technology and a commitment to community service as  
demonstrated through scientific leadership, public education, or  
community outreach. Winning scientists and engineers receive up to a  
five-year research grant to further their study in support of critical  
government missions.

Hi:
 
CSIRO has vacation studentships available for the Xmas period.
 
The closing date is 18 September 2009. 
 
I have included below the link to the advert -- it is also available by going to CSIRO careers website - the position number is 2009/549
 
https://recruitment.csiro.au/asp/Job_Details.asp?RefNo=2009%2F549 
 
My area is "Interacting with Information".
If someone is interested, I can send the projects we currently have in mind.
In brief:
    - 2 projects about using social networks to build communities
    - 4 projects around information seeking tasks and information provision (analysing search patterns, designing presentation strategies)
    - 3 projects around NLP building on our summarisation work -- one of them is on visualisation.
 
Kind regards
Cecile

Foreign Language Learning

    * Automatic Code-Switching (ACS) - The computer automatically
selects a few words in a user's native language communication (such as
a web page being viewed), and supplements or even replaces them with
their foreign language counterparts, thus naturally building up his
vocabulary. For example, if a sentence
              ????????
      (Chinese for "He is a good student.") appears in a Chinese
person's Web browser, the computer can insert student after ??
(optionally with additional information such as student's
pronunciation):
              ??????? (student)?
      After several times of such teaching, the computer can directly
replace future occurrences of ?? with student:
              ????? student?
      Ambiguous words such as the ? (Chinese for "see", "look",
"watch", "read", etc.) in
              ????????
      (Chinese for "He is reading a book before the TV.") can also be
automatically handled by listing all context-possible translations:
              ?????? (??: read; ??: watch) ??
      Practice is also possible:
              ????? [read? watch?] ??
      Because the computer would only teach and/or practice foreign
language elements at a small number of positions in the native
language article the user is viewing, the user wouldn't find it too
intrusive. Automatic code-switching can also teach grammatical
knowledge in similar ways.
    * Progressive Word Acquisition (PWA) - In ACS, long words are
optionally split into small segments (usually two syllables long) and
taught progressively, and even practiced progressively. For example,
when
              ?????
      (Chinese for "Colorado") first appears in a Chinese person's Web
browser, the computer inserts Colo' after it (optionally with Colo's
pronunciation):
              ????? (Colo')
      When ????? appears for the second time, the computer may decide
to test the user's memory about Colo' so it replaces ????? with
              Colo' (US state)
      Note that a hint such as "US state" is necessary in order to
differentiate this Colo' from other words beginning with Colo. For the
third occurrence of ?????, the computer teaches the full form,
Colorado, by inserting it after the Chinese occurrence:
              ????? (Colorado)
      At the fourth time, the computer may totally replace ????? with
              Colorado
      Not only the foreign language element (Colorado) can emerge
gradually, the original native language element (?????) can also
gradually fade out, either visually or semantically (e.g. ????? ->
???? -> ?? -> ?). This prevents the learner from suddenly losing the
Chinese clue, while also engages him in active recalls of the
occurrence's complete meaning (?????) with gradually reduced clues.
    * Subword Familiarization (SWF) - Again in ACS, word roots (e.g.
pro-, scrib-) and meaningless word fragments (e.g. -ot) are optionally
treated as two special kinds of standalone words and taught and
practiced in the user's incoming native language information.
Meaningless fragments are considered abbreviations and acronyms
derived from real, meaningful words. Getting the learner familiar with
all these subword units can facilitate the acquisition of longer, real
words that contain them.
    * Phonetics-Enhanced English (PEE) - The computer can add
non-intrusive diacritical marks (e.g. the mark in ?) above normal
English words to better reflect their pronunciations. Unlike radical
spelling reform proposals, a word's original literal form is always
preserved. Unlike annotating words with their IPA forms above,
diacritical marks are closely integrated with letters so a learner can
"read once and learn both the literal and the phonetic form." In
inputting English, the learner still uses the original literal form
only.
    * Orthography-Enhanced English (OEE) - Sometimes spelling a word
based on its pronunciation can be hard, even for native speakers. For
example, is it Lawrence or Lawrance? We can slightly change a word's
visual form to help recall its correct spelling. For example, when the
computer displays a word that has the -ance suffix (e.g. instance), it
can lower the letter a to some degree, just like Intel has a trademark
"intel" with a lowered e. Such a new visual form can help people
recall that the unclear letter in inst?nce is a because a is always
lowered in -ance while e is never lowered in -ence.

Computer-Assisted Foreign Language Writing

    * Input-Driven Syntax Aid (IDSA) - As a non-native English user
inputs a word, e.g. search, the word's sentence-making syntaxes are
prompted by the computer, e.g.
              v. search:  n. searcher search~ [n. search scope] [for
n. search target]
      so he can now write a syntactically valid sentence like "I'm
searching the room for the cat."
    * Input-Driven Ontology Aid (IDOA) - As a non-native English user
inputs a word, e.g. badminton, things (entities) and relations that
normally co-exist with the word in the same scenario or domain are
prompted as a systematic ontology graph by the computer, e.g. entities
like racquet, shuttlecock and playing court, relations like alternate,
serve and strike, and even full-scripted composition templates like
template: a badminton game. The benefits of the ontology aid are
twofold. First, the ontology helps the user verify that the "seed
word", badminton, is a valid concept in the intended scenario (or
context); second, the ontology pre-emptively exposes other valid words
in this context to the user, preventing him from using a wrong word,
e.g. bat (instead of racquet), from the very beginning.

Foreign Language Reading without Learning that Language

    * Full-Automatic Layered-Quality Machine Translation (FALQ-MT) -
Lexical and syntactic ambiguities are translated to fuzzy concepts and
structures instead of precise but error-prone results. Less
information is better than misinformation. If the reader can't guess
the meaning of a fuzzy occurrence from its context, he can "zoom in"
and see more detailed translation possibilities if he feels that
occurrence is important.

Foreign Language Writing without Learning that Language

    * Formal Language Writing and Machine Translation (FLW) - A person
not knowing a target language can generate information in that
language by composing in a formal language based on his native
vocabulary and having the composition machine-translated. Tools such
as the input-driven syntax aid and input-driven ontology aid can be
borrowed to assist the person in formal language writing. Manual word
sense disambiguation (WSD) can be conducted after the composition is
finished, on a domain-to-domain basis, because it is cognitively
easier for the writer to focus on a single domain at a time and answer
a series of questions "Does <word_i> belong to this domain?"

Ontology-Based Resource Sharing

    * Wikipedia-Based Resource Sharing (WP-RES) - A useful property of
Wikipedia is that each Wikipedia article or category can serve as a
unique address, or "coordinates", for the topic it corresponds to.
With this property, we can enable people with the same interest to
rendezvous at the same Wikipedia page and therefore talk with each
other. People could also register resources at a Wikipedia page's
External Links section so that other people with the same interest can
find them. People could even "subscribe" to a Wikipedia page for new
and updated resources and opportunities on that topic.

Ontology-Based Problem-Solving Skills Sharing

    * Wikipedia: From Knowledgebase to Strategybase (STRABASE) - If
we're solving a problem, say, a math problem, we choose a seemingly
promising strategy from our "strategy bases" in our minds, according
to the problem's main type and characteristic conditions. Such a
"strategy base" is something we can build up externally using a wiki.
A "strategy" is a special kind of knowledge that caters to certain
problem characteristics and provides certain problem-solving
frameworks. The wiki can store and categorize strategies and domain
knowledge by their intended problem types and characteristics, so the
human can better evaluate, select and apply strategies relevant to his
problem.

Miscellaneous

    * Chinese Pinyin Input Method Revisited (PYIME) - Today's Chinese
pinyin input methods inherit the single-row candidates window from the
DOS era. If we categorize candidate characters into multiple rows
according to some criteria, the user can more easily home in on his
desired character. For example, each row contains characters that have
the same phonetic radical, and one row reads "? ? ? ? ?", while
another row reads "? ? ?". Rows can also correspond to the five
possible tones in Chinese, as most mainland Chinese don't type tones.
Still, there can be a special, first row for the most frequently used
words and characters.
    * A Politically Correct New Name for English (ARCS) - As
technology like automatic code-switching would make English a much
cheaper commodity for non-native people to acquire, for the first time
it will become possible for most people in the world to use decent
English. But nationalist sentiments can be a negative factor for some
people to adopt English. While it is logically recognized by everybody
that all natural languages are actually made of equally random
syllables, emotionally people can still more or less feel unequal that
one language is more international than others. A reason for this
paradox is that languages are named by their nations of origin:
English, French, Spanish, etc. Therefore, we can use a "renaming"
technique to better reflect a language's random nature rather than
nationalist connotation. Actually, the word "language" itself already
has a strong nationalist connotation, and I propose the term "code
system" to eliminate that connotation. As for English, let's rename it
as "A Random Code System", or ARCS for short.
    * Foreign Language Proficiency Measurement (FLPM) - How does a
non-native speaker introduce his language level to a native speaker in
an understandable manner? The computer can test his proficiency and
compare it with native speakers at different ages. Introductions like
"My English level is like a 10-year-old American child" should be
understood well by a native speaker.

Following on from the successful Designing the Australian National
Corpus workshop held during SummerFest 2008, HCSNet (the ARC Research
Network in Human Communication) is organising a workshop on Building
the Australian National Corpus to be held as part of SummerFest 2009.

This workshop focuses on current developments and emerging
possibilities in language data gathering and tools that might
complement existing collections of language data in building the
Australian National Corpus.

While sources like the World Wide Web have enormous potential there
are numerous challenges facing those wishing to draw out
linguistically relevant data from the Web. In constructing the
Australian National Corpus, then, a wider range of data sources needs
to be drawn upon. The aim of the workshop is thus to bring together
researchers with expertise in corpus and web linguistics along with
corpus building and annotation in a single forum in order to work
towards strategies to capitalize on the potential for language data in
existing as well as new collections to be incorporated into the
Australian National Corpus in a principled manner.

Topics include but are not limited to:

    * Using the web as a source of corpus data
    * Bringing existing data collections into the AusNC
    * Making existing data useful in other fields of research
    * Proposed models for collecting new data
    * Legal issues for data collection and sharing
    * Technical infrastructure and requirements
    * Long term curation of the AusNC

There will be a keynote presentation by Prof. Gerhard Leitner from
Frieie Universitat Berlin. Prof. Leitner is the author of the two
volume book "Australia's Many Voices" (2004, Mouton de Gruyter),
co-editor of "The habitat of Australia's Aboriginal Languages" (2007,
Mouton de Gruyter) and "Language in Australia and New Zealand. A
Bibliography and Research Database, 1788-present" (2006, 2008), and
was also involved in the construction of the Indian English component
of the International Corpus of English.

Call for Papers
 
Joint Conference on Digital Libraries JCDL 2010
 
June 21-25, 2010  Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia.
 
http://www.jcdl2010.org/
 
Sponsored by ACM SIGIR, ACM SIGWEB, ASIS&T, and IEEE-CS TCDL
 
The ACM/IEEE-CS Joint Conference on Digital Libraries (JCDL) is the major international research forum focused on digital libraries and associated technical, practical, and social issues. JCDL encompasses the many meanings of the term "digital libraries", including (but not limited to) new forms of information institutions; operational information systems with all manner of digital content; new means of selecting, collecting, organizing, distributing, and evaluating digital content; and theoretical models of information media, including document genres and electronic publishing. Digital libraries are distinguished from information retrieval systems because they include more types of media, provide additional functionality and services, and include other stages of the information life cycle, from creation through use. Digital libraries can also be viewed as an extension of the services libraries currently provide.
 
The theme of JCL 2010 is ?Digital Libraries ? 10 years past, 10 years forward, a 2020 vision?. This theme reflects the fact that the context in which digital libraries were originally conceived has significantly changed in the context of new information models embodied in Web 2.0 and popular social networking applications. In this spirit, we are especially interested in papers that address and demonstrate new models of collaborative, participatory information interaction increasingly ubiquitous in the Web 2.0 context.
 
JCDL 2010 invites submissions of papers and proposals for posters, demonstrations, tutorials, and workshops that will make the conference an exciting and creative event to attend. As always, the conference welcomes contributions from all the fields that intersect to enable Digital Libraries. Topics include, but are not limited to:
 
?       Collaborative and participatory information environments
 
?       Cyberinfrastructure architectures, applications, and deployments
 
?       Data mining/extraction of structure from networked information
 
?       Digital library and Web Science curriculum development
 
?       Evaluation of online information environments
 
?       Impact and evaluation of digital information in education
 
?       Information policy and copyright law
 
?       Personal digital information management
 
?       Retrieval and browsing
 
?       Social networks and networked information
 
?       Social-technical perspectives of digital information
 
?       Studies of human factors in networked information
 
?       Systems, algorithms, and models for data preservation
 
?       Theoretical models of information interaction and organization
 
?       Visualization of large-scale information environments
 
Important Dates
 
?         All papers are due Monday, January 25, 2010 at 5 PM EST.
