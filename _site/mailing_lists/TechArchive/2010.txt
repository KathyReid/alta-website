PostDoc (2 years) position available at the Radboud University Nijmegen.

*Job description*

The FP7 Marie Curie Initial Training Network "BBfor2" (Bayesian Biometrics
for Forensics) provides an opportunity for young researchers to study
several biometric technologies in a forensic context.  The Network consists
of 9 European research institutes and 3 associated partners.  The Network
will provide regular workshops and Summer Schools, so that the 15 PhD
students (Early Stage Researchers - ESRs) and PostDocs (Experienced
Researchers - ERs) and senior researchers can exchange research experience,
insights and ideas.   The main areas of research are Speaker Recognition,
Face Recognition, Fingerprint Recognition, but also combinations of these
techniques are studied.  The challenge of applying biometric techniques in a
forensic context is to be able to deal with the uncontrolled quality of the
evidence, and to provide calibrated likelihood scores.  The researchers in
this Network will have the opportunity during their assignment to stay for
some period at another Network institute and to get experience in an
industrial or forensic laboratory.


The PostDoc in the Network will be responsible for the scientific cohesion
in the Network.  He or she will work together with the PhD students in the
Network, translate research approaches across biometric modalities, while
overseeing the overall issues from biometric technology to forensic
application.  There will be a strong emphasis on organisational and
reporting skills, stimulating, combining and extending research carried out
in the Network, resulting in scientific publications. The PostDoc will work
in close collaboration with the Scientific Co-ordinator of the Network.
Successful candidates have extensive experience in Machine Learning, Speech
or Image Processing, Forensic Sciences or related areas.  Experience with
processing of large data sets and skills in programming and scripting are
important qualifications.

*Requirements*

Candidates should comply with the rules set forward by the FP7 Marie Curie
ITNs:  Candidates should

 - be transferring from another country, i.e., not be of Dutch nationality,
and not have resided more than 12 months in the last 3 years in The
Netherlands.
 - be  willing to work in at least one other country in the BBfor2 network.

 - hold a PhD, and have less than 5 years of research experience since their
master degree.

*Organization*

The project will be carried out within the Centre for Language and Speech
Technology (CLST), a research unit within the Faculty of Arts of the Radboud
University Nijmegen.  The CLST hosts a large international group of senior
researchers and PhD students who do research at the frontier of science and
develop innovative applications.

*Conditions of employment*

The duration of the contract is 2 years. The PostDoc will receive an initial
contract for the duration of one year, with the possibility of prolongation
for another 1 year.  The salary is in accordance with the rules of the Marie
Curie ITNs.  In addition to the salary, travel allowances and career
exploratory allowances are foreseen according to generous Marie Curie ITN
provisions.

*Additional information*

For further information about the position, please contact David van
Leeuwen, d.vanleeuwen at let.ru.nl .

*Application*

Letters of application, including extensive CVs, (with reference to the
vacancy number 23.01.10 and preferably by e-mail) can be sent to:

The PhD student will investigate automatic speaker recognition in the
forensic environment.  The research will include theoretical aspects such as
developing a general framework for evidence evaluation and reporting, and
experimental aspects by conducting studies with automatic speaker
recognition systems.   The candidate will collaborate with other PhD
students and senior researchers in the Network, in a highly
interdisciplinary environment.  Successful candidates have a Master Degree
in Computer Science, Engineering or other relevant disciplines with a strong
background in pattern recognition and / or signal processing, and excellent
