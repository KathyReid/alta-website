# ALTA Website

This site is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and designed to be hosted using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Building

To build locally (eg to test changes) you can simply clone the repository and then run

`jekyll serve`

and browse to http://127.0.0.1:4000


## Updating

Content is mostly stored in normal HTML files. The key other files to know about are: `_layouts/default.html` for most pages and `_layouts/home.html` for the index page. Other useful config (when it is not stored in the Jekyll-standard YAML prefix on the HTML file) lives in `_config.yml`.
