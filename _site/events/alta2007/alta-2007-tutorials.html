<h3>Tutorial 1</h3>

<b>Presenter</b>: Shlomo Berkovsky<br>
<b>Title</b>: Web Personalization and Recommender Systems<br>

<p>
<b>Abstract</b>:
</p>

<p>
During the last years, the quantity of potentially interesting Web-based
information services has been growing rapidly and exceeds human processing
capabilities. In many situations the users would like to choose among
numerous alternative services, but do not have sufficient knowledge,
capabilities or time to make such decisions. As such, there is a pressing
need for intelligent systems that assist users while taking into account
their personal needs and interests and deliver service in a way that will
be most appropriate and valuable to the users. These types of systems are
referred to as personalization systems.
</p>

<p>
This tutorial focuses on recommender systems, a typical example of
personalization systems, which provide users with recommendations about
services they may like. In these systems, generation of personalized
recommendations is achieved by exploiting various knowledge sources, which
store information collected during past interactions between the system
and the users. Extensive research of recommender systems started over a
decade ago and yielded a wide variety of recommendation techniques, such
as content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, knowledge-based
recommendations, utility-based recommendations and their multiple
hybridizations.
</p>

<p>
This tutorial will include an overview of current recommender system
applications, examples of Web-based recommender systems, a detailed
overview of the most widely-used recommendation techniques, and a set of
recommender systems design principles. No prior experience with
recommender systems is necessary.
</p>

<p>
Shlomo Berkovsky is a Research Fellow at the Computer Science and Software
Engineering Department (The University of Melbourne). His research focuses
on recommender systems, user modeling and mediation of user models in
recommender systems.

<h3>Tutorial 2</h3>

<b>Presenter</b>: David Martinez<br>
<b>Title</b>: Experimental method and Evaluation in Word Sense Disambiguation

<p>
<b>Abstract</b>:
</p>

<p>
Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) has been studied as a separate NLP
task since the early work on Machine Translation on the
fifties. Defined as a classification task with a fixed list of senses,
it has provided a common framework for experimentation on semantic
phenomena. More recently, since 1998, the Senseval challenge has
provided the opportunity for researchers on this area to present and
evaluate their systems. These evaluations have shown that
state-of-the-art systems are able to achieve around 70% accuracy for
fine-grained sense distinctions, but only when hand-tagged data from
the same corpus is provided. These systems are called supervised, and
have well-known limitations in scalability and portability to other
domains.
</p>

<p>
A different approach to WSD is the unsupervised setting, where word
senses are induced directly from the corpus. Typically these systems
involve clustering techniques, which group together similar
examples. The evaluation of these methods is not straightforward and
may involve the mapping into a known inventory or the use of
goldstandard clusters.
</p>

<p>
Together with these views of the WSD problem, other related tasks have
been proposed as a way to analyse the semantics of the text, such as
semantic role labelling, identification of affectiveness, or lexical
substitution. The goal of all these tasks is to link the text to some
semantic representation. In 2007, the Senseval framework changed its
name to Semeval (Semantic Evaluations) to accommodate these tasks in a
common framework.
</p>

<p>
The motivation of this tutorial is to provide an overview of
experimentation and evaluation for WSD and closely related tasks. We
will focus on the tasks and systems presented in Senseval and the
recent Semeval 2007 workshop, but will also cover other domains where
WSD systems are being applied, such as biomedicine.
