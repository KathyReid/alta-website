      <h1>Tutorials: Friday 9 December</h1>

<p>
On 9 December, a tutorial day will be organised.  The following people
will give 90 minute tutorials:
</p>
<ul>
<li>09:00 <a href="#stokes">Nicola Stokes: Document Summarisation</a>
<li>11:00 <a href="#dras">Mark Dras: Tree-Adjoining Grammar</a>
<li>14:00 <a href="#cohn">Trevor Cohn: Conditional Random Fields</a>
<li>16:00 <a href="#cavedon">Lawrence Cavedon: Dialogue Systems</a>
</ul>

<h3>Dialogue, Dialogue Models, and Dialogue Management Systems</h3>

<h4>Lawrence Cavedon, NICTA Victoria Laboratory, University of
Melbourne</h4>

<p>
Dialogue is a complex process, involving many aspects of
language-based communication (both verbal and non-verbal),
interactivity, and pragmatic reasoning. The study of dialogue and
dialogue systems cuts across the fields of linguistics, language
technology, artificial intelligence, psychology, and sociology (and
more!).  This tutorial discusses the process of dialogue interaction
between two or more participants, and introduces salient phenomena,
issues, and challenges that arise in modeling dialogue and building
powerful dialogue systems. We will begin by covering the types of
dialogue models typically used by toolkits for building commercial
dialogue applications, and discuss strategies used to make such
systems perform more robustly.  We then move on to more semantically
rich models of dialogue, and architectures and systems designed for
complex dialogue-based interaction in complex settings. Time
permitting, we may also address issues such as multimodal interaction
and the use of ontologies in dialogue system engineering.  The
outcomes of this tutorial will be an appreciation of some of the
exciting issues in designing complex dialogue systems, and an overview
of current research areas in the field.
</p>

<h5>Bio</h5>

<p>
Lawrence Cavedon is a Senior Researcher at National ICT Australia, in
the Victoria Research Laboratory, and also holds a lecturing position
in the School of Computer science and IT at RMIT University. Until
July 2005 he was a senior research engineer at Stanford University's
Centre for the Study of Language and Information (CSLI), where he
helped develop a multi-application dialogue management system. This
system is currently being applied in a number of projects, including
control of in-car devices, tracking multi-party multi-modal meetings,
and intelligent tutoring. Lawrence has also held positions in industry
R&amp;D labs. As well as dialogue, Lawrence's research interests
include collaboration in multi-agent systems and formal models of
reasoning.  He holds a PhD in Cognitive Science from the University of
Edinburgh.

<h3>Conditional Random Fields</h3>

<h4>Trevor Cohn, Department of Computer Science, University of
Melbourne</h4>

<p>
Conditional Random Fields are an exciting new log-linear model which
allows probabilistic modelling and inference over complex labelling
decisions given an observation. This framework has been used in the
fields of natural language processing tasks, genetics and computer
vision, often producing state-of-the-art results. This tutorial will
describe CRFs and how they relate to generative models such as the
hidden Markov model and dynamic Bayesian networks. CRFs will also be
compared to maximum entropy models and maximum entropy Markov models.
The process of estimating model parameters of a CRF and decoding
(finding the maximum a posteriori labelling) will be described, for
both the traditional chain structured graphs, as used in sequence
labelling tasks, and more complicated, loopy structures. The use of
different prior distributions is often required in order to regularise
the model (reduce the degree of over-fitting) - some of the
regularisation methods will be covered. Finally, the course will
describe tractability issues inherent in CRFs, and some techniques
with which these problems have been countered.
</p>

<h5>Bio</h5>

<p>
Trevor Cohn is a PhD student at the University of Melbourne, studying
Conditional Random Fields for Natural Language Processing under Steven
Bird and Miles Osborne. He graduated from University of Melbourne in
2000 with BEng(Software, Hons) and BComm, then worked in industry as a
Software Engineer for three years before returning to academia. He has
recently returned from a year long visit to the University of
Edinburgh.

<h3>Tree Adjoining Grammar and Related Approaches</h3>

<h4>Mark Dras, Department of Computing, Macquarie University</h4>

<p>
A focus of a significant part of mid-twentieth century linguistics was
investigating formalisms for representing language that were
constrained, with an associated question: What can these constraints
say about the nature of language? The notion of constrained formalisms
was taken up strongly by the field of computer science in the
development of programming languages, but became less central in
linguistics. In computational linguistics, however, the trend
continued with several different formalisms: Tree Adjoining Grammar,
Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar, and Combinatory Categorial
Grammar, among others. This approach allowed the consideration of the
complexity of processing of language -- both computational processing
and human processing -- with a perspective different from that of
other approaches. This tutorial will focus on Tree Adjoining Grammar
(TAG), an approach that, broadly speaking, takes trees assigned to
individual words as the core element of language representation --
rather than linear rules, systems, or pairs of structures -- along
with a restricted definition of tree combination. The tutorial will
look at several aspects: the definition of TAG; some formal
properties; the XTAG project, a primary goal of which has been to
build a large-scale grammar of English, along with work on other
languages; parsers and other computational machinery for TAG, along
with issues of complexity of processing; supertagging and 'almost
parsing', the assigning of structured tags to lexical items; the
Synchronous TAG formalism, and its use as a representation for pairing
language and action, in the context of human-like computational
agents; and the relationship of TAG to other related formalisms.

Mark Dras is a lecturer in the Department of Computing, Macquarie
University. He did his PhD in computational linguistics, on
characterising paraphrase as an optimisation problem and looking at
related representational questions, at the Microsoft Research
Institute and Macquarie University, completing in 1999. That was
followed by a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of
Pennsylvania in the Institute for Research in Cognitive Science, with
Professor Aravind Joshi. His research interests can be broadly
characterised as language transformations: paraphrase, machine
translation and formal representations for describing them and their
properties.

<h3>Automatic Summarisation: Picking out the best bits!</h3>


<h4>Nicola Stokes, NICTA Victoria Laboratory, University of
Melbourne</h4>

<p>
The aim of text summarisation is to identify the most important
information in a source document, and present the user with a
coherent, abridged version containing its core message.  This tutorial
will review the state of the art in automatic text summarisation. In
particular, the various statistical and symbolic/linguistic approaches
to single document, multi-document and question-focused summarisation
will be explored. The principal challenges and remaining problems in
summarisation research will also be discussed. One of these challenges
concerns the development of meaningful evaluation metrics for
measuring summary quality, i.e. summary coverage and readabilty. This
tutorial will review some of the automatic and manual summarisation
evaluation methodologies proposed by DUC Workshop participants, that
aim to address the problem of variability in human quality judgements.
</p>

<h5>Bio</h5>

<p>
Nicola Stokes is a NICTA Research Fellow based at the NICTA Victoria
Laboratory at the University of Melbourne. She is also a member of the
UniMelb Language Technology group, and is currently working on the
NICTA Interactive Information Discovery and Delivery (I2D2) project
with Steven Bird and Tim Baldwin (among others). Prior to joining
NICTA, Nicola was a Postdoctoral Researcher with the Text
Summarisation group at the Department of Computer Science, University
College Dublin (UCD). During her PhD studies at UCD, she investigated
the application of lexical cohesion analysis in a number of IR and NLP
tasks in the broadcast news and newswire domain, including breaking
news story detection, news story segmentation and news story gisting.
Her current research interests include Multi-document Summarisation,
Question Answering, Textual Entailment and Paraphrase Identification.
