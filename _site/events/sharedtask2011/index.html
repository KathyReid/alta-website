<p>Welcome to the Language Technology Programming Competition. This
competition is organised by <a href="http://alta.asn.au">ALTA</a>.</p>

<h3>What is ALTA?</h3>

<p>ALTA is the Australasian Language Technology Association. ALTA's
mission is to promote language technology research and development in
Australia and New Zealand. ALTA organises workshops
like <a href="http://www.alta.asn.au/events/alta2011">ALTA 2011</a>,
and supports competitions like the Australian High-School
Computational and Linguistics Olympiad (OzCLO) and this programming
competition.</p>

<h3>What is this competition about?</h3>

<p>This is our second programming competition and it aims at
university students with programming experience. The competition is
formatted as a &quot;shared task&quot;: all participants compete to
solve the same problem. The problem is the object of active research
and nobody has (yet) obtained 100% correct results. In this
competition, the winner will be the team who obtains the best
results. If you participate and obtain 100% results you should
definitely consider doing a PhD on the topic!</p>

<p>There are no limitations on the size of the teams or the means that
they can use to solve the problem, <strong>as long as the processing
is fully automatic - there should be no human
intervention</strong>. We will give you a sample of data for you to
use and develop your system from the point you decide to join the
competition. In early October we will send test data, and you will
have a few days to run your program and send us your result. After you
receive the results, to qualify for the price you will also need to
write a poster that describes the methods that you used to obtain the
results. Selected posters will be displayed at ALTA 2011.</p>

<h3>What do I get if I win?</h3>

<p>The winning team of the student category will be invited to attend
ALTA 2011 in Canberra. We are still looking for sponsors for
additional prizes. If you are interested in sponsoring this event,
contact Diego Molla
(<a href="mailto:shared.task@alta.asn.au">shared.task@alta.asn.au</a>).</p>

<h3>How do I register?</h3>

<p>To register, send an email to Diego Molla
(<a href="mailto:shared.task@alta.asn.au">shared.task@alta.asn.au</a>)
with the following information:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Name of your team;</li>
    <li>Name and current studies, including the current year, degree
    name, and university (e.g. &quot;third year of the Bachelor of IT
    at Macquarie University&quot;) of each team member.</li>
</ul>

<p>We will send you a confirmation message and the training data for
this year's task.</p>
