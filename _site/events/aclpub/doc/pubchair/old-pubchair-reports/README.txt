ACL collects various reports every year, including a report from the
publications chair for the main ACL conference.  The report usually
mentions improvements, problems, future work, etc.

It is pretty easy to find these reports via a search engine, at
aclweb.org or sometimes elsewhere.  But it would be helpful to put a
copy here for quick reference.  If this directory is not up to date,
please update it.

Beyond adding your own report to this directory, you should probably
modify the general instructions to pub chairs in the parent directory!
