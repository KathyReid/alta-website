This is the aclpub package.
Please see the doc subdirectory for documentation.

HISTORY
-------
The aclpub package and documentation were built in 2005 by 
Jason Eisner and Philipp Koehn, based in part on scripts by David
Yarowsky that had been used for several years previously.

Use the "cvs log" command to see what changes have been made since then.
Please feel free to make further improvements.  

ANONYMOUS CHECKOUT
------------------
Anyone can check out the latest version anonymously as follows:
   cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@ftp.clsp.jhu.edu:/aclpub checkout aclpub
 
MAINTAINING THE CODE, DOCUMENTATION, TEMPLATES, AND STYLE FILES
---------------------------------------------------------------
Publication chairs and other interested users are expected to improve 
the aclpub package for themselves and future users.  

Simply modify your own checked-out copy of the package, and commit
those changes back into the CVS repository as appropriate.

To do this, you must obtain a username and password by emailing
   Jason Eisner <jason at cs dot jhu dot edu>
and including "aclpub" in the subject line.  

Then specify your password once via
  cvs -d :pserver:USERNAME@ftp.clsp.jhu.edu:/aclpub login
This will record password information in ~/.cvspass.

Thereafter, you can run commands that interact with the repository via
  cvs -d :pserver:USERNAME@ftp.clsp.jhu.edu:/aclpub <command>
where <command> is something like "checkout aclpub", "update", "commit", 
or "help".

NOTE: 

If you want to simplify the above to
  cvs <command>
then just set an environment variable in your shell startup file:
  export CVSROOT=:pserver:USERNAME@ftp.clsp.jhu.edu:/aclpub
Alternatively, you could simplify to
  aclcvs <command>
by defining a shell alias:
  alias aclcvs='cvs -d :pserver:USERNAME@ftp.clsp.jhu.edu:/aclpub'

We would have preferred to use Subversion instead of CVS, but on many
systems only CVS is installed by default.  We could switch over in future.
