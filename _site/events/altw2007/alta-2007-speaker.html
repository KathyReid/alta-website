<b>Title:</b>
Text mining techniques for building a Biolexicon
</p>

<p>
<b>Abstract:</b>
My talk will focus on building a biolexicon by leveraging existing
bio-resources, combining them within a common, standardized lexical,
terminological, conceptual representation framework and employing
advanced NL technologies to discover new terms, concepts, relations
and linguistic lexical information from text. In particular I will
discuss term normalisation techniques, named entity recognition and a
smart dictionary look up. This research forms part of the National
Centre for Text Mining (www.nactem.ac.uk)  and the project BOOTStrep.
</p>

<p>
<b>Bio:</b>
Sophia Ananiadou is Reader in Text Mining in CS and Deputy Director of
the National Centre for Text Mining (NaCTeM). She has worked in NLP
since 1983 and is the main developer of the terminology management
services provided by NaCTeM. Her current research includes building
bio-lexica and bio-ontologies for gene regulation (FT6 IST,
BOOTStrep), the text-mining-based visualisation of the provenance of
biochemical networks (REFINE), text mining for systematic reviews
(ASSERT) and integrating Life Science data (ONDEX). She is recipient
of the 2004 Daiwa Adrian prize (jointly with Prof. Tsujii) for her
research in Knowledge Mining for Biology, and in 2006 of the IBM UIMA
innovation award for leading work on the interoperability of
text-mining (TM) tools.

<b>Title:</b>
Does language technology offer anything to small languages?
</p>

<p>
<b>Abstract:</b> The effort currently going into recording the smaller
and perhaps more endangered languages of the world may result in
computationally tractable documents in those languages, but to date
there has not been a tradition of corpus creation for these
languages. In this talk I will outline the language situation of
Australia's neighbouring region and discuss methods currently used in
language documentation, observing that it is quite difficult to get
linguists to create reusable records of the languages they record, let
alone expecting them to create marked-up corpora. I will highlight the
importance of creating shared infrastructure to support our work,
including the development of Pacific and Regional Archive for Digital
Sources in Endangered Cultures (PARADISEC), a facility for curation of
linguistic data.
</p>

<p>
<b>Bio:</b> Nick Thieberger studied French and linguistics at LaTrobe
University and submitted his MA thesis titled <i>Aboriginal Language
Maintenance: Some Issues and Strategies</i> in 1988. He worked at the
School of Australian Linguistics in Batchelor then at the Institute of
Applied Aboriginal Studies in Perth in the mid 1980s and then
established Wangka Maya, the Pilbara Aboriginal language centre, in
Port Hedland, supporting documentation of local Aboriginal
languages. He worked at the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and
Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS) from 1991-1995 developing an
archive of electronic data related to Aboriginal studies.

From 1995-1997 he was an Australian Volunteer at the Vanuatu Cultural
Centre where he began documenting the language of South Efate. His PhD
dissertation was a grammatical description of that language, together
with a corpus of linked video, audio and text files, glossed texts and
a dictionary.

Nick came to Melbourne University to take up PhD studies in
1998. Since then he has also worked as a consultant on Native Title
issues and on several joint projects with AIATSIS. His research
interests focus on language documentation, metadata for archiving
linguistic data, computer tools for linguistic data management, and
audio and text linkage for representation of linguistic
information. He took up an ARC Postdoctoral Fellowship in July 2004,
and continues to work as Project Manager of the Pacific And Regional
Archive for Digital Sources in Endangered Cultures (PARADISEC).

<b>Title:</b>
Measures of Measurements: Robust Evaluation of Search Systems
</p>

<p>
<b>Abstract:</b> A good search system is one that helps a user to find
useful documents. When building a new system, we hope, or hypothesise,
that it will be more effective than existing alternatives. We apply a
measure, which is often a drastic simplification, to establish whether
the system is effective. Thus the ability of the system to help users
and the measurement of this ability are only weakly connected, by
assumptions that the researcher may not even be aware of. But how
robust are these assumptions? If they are poor, is the research
invalid? Such concerns apply not just to search, but to many other
data-processing tasks. In this talk I introduce some of the recent
developments in evaluation of search systems, and use these
developments to examine some of the assumptions that underlie much of
the research in this field.

<b>Bio:</b> 
Professor Justin Zobel is leading the Computing for Life
Sciences initiative within National ICT Australia's Victorian
Laboratory. He received his PhD from the University of Melbourne and
for many years was based in the School of CS&IT at RMIT University,
where he led the Search Engine group. He is an Editor-in-Chief of the
International Journal of Information Retrieval, an associate editor of
ACM Transactions on Information Systems and of Information Processing
& Management, and was until recently Treasurer of ACM SIGIR. In the
research community, he is best known for his role in the development
of algorithms for efficient text retrieval. He is the author of
"Writing for Computer Science" and his interests include search,
bioinformatics, fundamental data structures, and research methods.
