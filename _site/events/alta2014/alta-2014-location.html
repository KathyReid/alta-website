<h2>ALTA Workshop 2014 at
RMIT - Local Information</h2>

<center>For the most recent version, download the <a href="resources/alta2014local_info.pdf">PDF<a></center>

<p><b>The Venue</b></p>

<p>ALTA 2014 is being held in RMIT
Building 80, located at <b>445 Swanston Street</b>, between Franklin St and La
Trobe St (closer to Franklin)<a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/RMIT+University/@-37.807314,144.964293,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x8a729628b77319df">(see Google Maps).</a></p>

<p>The ALTA tutorials and other talks are
being held in room 80.01.02: enter Building 80 through its left-most door on
Swanston St, next to the Oxford Hotel, go past the cafe and down a few steps to
the lecture room.</p>

<p><b>WIFI</b> is available; use eduroam or the provided guest account: details available at the registration desk.

<p><b>Getting there ... from Melbourne Airport</b></p>

<p >A <b>taxi</b> is probably about $55;
have the taxi drop you off at the corner of Swanston and Franklin Sts.</p>

<p >Cheapest option is <b>Skybus</b>,
express bus service from the airport to Southern Cross train station on Spencer
St: $18 one-way, $30 return. From Southern Cross station, you could walk in
about 20 minutes, get a taxi, or walk north along Spencer St to La Trobe St and
catch the free (brown) city-circle tram to Swanston St.</p>

<p> <b>... from the Conference Hotels</b></p>

<p >From the Ibis Hotel it's a 5 mins walk
around the corner of Victoria St; from the Tune Hotel it's 5 mins walk south
along Swanston St; from Rydges, it's a 10 min south along Swanston St, or you
can catch a  tram - for that, you'll need a myki ticket ($6 from a convenience
store).</p>

<p><b>Lunch on Wednesday</b></p>

<p>Lunch is not provided on Wednesday but
there's a cafe in the building, or walk south along Swanston ST for a couple of
options. Or cross La Trobe St to Melbourne Central and its food court. If you
turn the corner of Franklin west and walk a block to Elizabeth St, you'll find
a cluster of great cheap Asian lunch options (Rose Garden is a favourite).</p>

<p> <b>Dinner on Wednesday</b></p>

<p >Victoria Market has its Night Market
on Wednesday nights, a fun experience for a range of food, music and arts/craft
stalls: it's only a few minutes walk from the venue, west along Franklin St.</p>

<p>Another fun option is the Night Noodle
Markets at Burrarung Mar, down on the river behind Federation Square.</p>

<p>Or you can walk to Lygon St: the south
end has a cluster of Asian restaurants, or stroll north to the many Italian
restaurants. If you feel like a longer walk, it's 20 minutes to Fitzroy,
hipster central of the southern hemisphere, with a ton of restaurants, cafes,
and great bars.</p>

<p><b>Lunch on Thursday/Friday</b></p>

<p>Lunch during the conference proper
will be provided at the venue (along with morning/afternoon tea).</p>

<p><b>Dinner on Thursday</b></p>

<p >The official conference dinner, joint
between ALTA and ADCS, will be at the <a href="http://www.theclydehotel.com.au/">Clyde Hotel</a>, a 15 minute walk north from
the conference venue, or a 10 minute walk from the hotels. Or you can catch a
tram up Swanston St if you have a myki card!</p>

<p>We'll be requesting pre-orders during
Thursday to try and ensure there's not too long a wait for the food. Most mains
are between about $15-20 (there will be free snacks/entrees provided on
arrival).</p>

<p><b>Drinks and After Dinner</b></p>

<p>The <b>Oxford Hotel</b> is next door
to the venue. Grab a burger and talk union matters at the <b>John Curtin Hotel </b>on
Lygon St, across the road from Trades Hall. Dessert and coffee at <b>Brunetti</b>'s
is a Carlton must. <b>Jimmy Watson's Wine Bar</b> is another Carlton
institution. Or go to <b>Markov</b>'s on Drummond St for the name and stay for
the cocktails. Head to <b>Brunswick St Fitzroy</b> (15-20 min walk) for a whole
bunch of great bars: <b>Naked for Satan </b>has pinxtos and a rooftop bar with
great views (try to go for sunset); <b>Little Creatures</b> <b>Beer Hall</b>
has a great selection of local beers; <b>Black Pearl</b> and the <b>Evelyn
Hotel</b> were both recently named in a list of top-50 best bars in the world.</p>

<p><b>Coffee</b></p>
<p>This is Melbourne, so great coffee can be had just about anywhere. But if you're a person that needs to know the name of the farmer in Guatemala that grew your beans, or want the details of the roasting process used for your cup (on the premises of course), or demand a very specific temperature to the water poured over your beans, then visit one of the following: it's only a few minutes to world-renowned (really) <b>Seven Seeds</b>; <b>Market Lane</b> has a presence in Vic Market and a literal hole-in-the-wall on Faraday St in Carlton; or if you're in Fitzroy, visit <b>Industry Beans</b>, <b>De Clieu</b>, or nearby <b>Proud Mary</b>.  </p>

<p><b>What about the Weekend?</b></p>

<p>If you're staying on in Melbourne for the weekend:</p>

<p>If you have a morning: Visit <b>Queen
Victoria Markets</b>. Or walk to <b>Fitzroy</b> via the Carlton Gardens, past
the Exhibition Building and Melbourne Museum: visit the Rose Street Art Market
and take a walking tour of Melbourne's oldest suburb and mingle with the
hipsters having breakfast or brunch: do a loop around Brunswick St, Johnston
St, Smith St and Gertrude St.</p>

<p >Or head down Swanston St to the Yarra
River to <b>Federation Square</b> and surrounds, including the National Gallery
of Victoria and the Botanical Gardens.</p>

<p>If you have the afternoon as well, you
can catch a tram (no. 1 down Swanston St) to <b>St Kilda</b>, on the beach,
another great Melbourne suburb. Sunday has an art market on the Esplanade, but
if you're at St Kilda at dusk, take a walk to the end of the pier---if you're
lucky you might some fairy penguins climbing up onto the rocks.</p>

<p >If you want to get out of town and you
have a car, then the <b>Yarra Valley wine district</b> is just over an hour out
of town; <b>Phillip Island</b> (and its surf beaches and penguin colony) is a
couple of hours drive way; <b>Wilsons Prom</b> is closer to 3 hours away. If
you have the whole weekend, then a trip to the best parts of the <b>Great Ocean
Road</b> is about 4 hours each way.</p>
