<h1>Invited talks at ALTA 2013</h1>
</center>

<p>We are pleased to announce that Bonnie Webber and Mark Steedman will give invited talks.</p>

<h2>Mark Steedman</h2>

<h3>Robust Computational Semantics</h3>
<p> 
Practical tasks like question answering and machine translational
ultimately require computing meaning representations that support
inference.  Standard linguistic accounts of meaning are impracticable
for such purposes, both because they assume non-monotonic operations
such as quantifier movement, and because they lack a representation
for the meaning of content words that supports efficient computation
of entailment. I'll discuss practical solutions to some of these
problems within a near-context free grammar formalism for a working
wide-coverage parser, in current work with Mike Lewis, and show how
these solutions can be usefully applied in NLP tasks.
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark Steedman</b> is Professor of Cognitive Science in the School of
Informatics at the University of Edinburgh, where he moved in 1998
from the University of Pennsylvania, after teaching for many years as
Professor in the Department of Computer and Information Science.  He
is a Fellow of the British Academy, the Royal Society of Edinburgh,
the American Association for Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), the
Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), and the Cognitive
Science Society (CSS), and a Member of the European Academy.
</p>

<p>
His research covers a range of problems in computational linguistics,
natural language processing, artificial intelligence, computer
science, and cognitive science, including syntax and semantics of
natural language, and parsing and interpretation of natural language
discourse, including spoken intonation, by humans and by machine.
Much of his current research uses Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG)
as a formalism to address problems in wide-coverage parsing for robust
semantic interpretation and natural language inference, and the
problem of inducing and generalizing statistical parsers from data and
grounded meaning representations, including those arising in robotics
domains, and in child language acquisition.  Some of his research
concerns the analysis of music using similar statistical methods.

<h3>Concurrent Discourse Relations</h3>

<p>
The Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) was released to the public in 2008 and remains
the largest corpus of manually annotated discourse relations -- both relations that
are signaled explicitly (e.g., by a coordinating or subordinating conjunction, or
by a discourse adverbial or other construction) and ones that otherwise appear implicit.
</p>
<p>
The Penn Discourse TreeBank also diverges from other discourse-annotated corpora in
permitting more than one discourse relation to be annotated as holding concurrently.
Annotators could indicate this by assigning multiple sense labels to an explicit
connective. Or, in those cases where adjacent sentences had no explicit connective,
annotators could indicate concurrent discourse relations by either annotating a single
implicit connective that concurrently conveyed multiple senses or annotating multiple
implicit connectives, each conveying one of the concurrent relation(s). Subsequent
experiments carried out using Mechanical Turk showed that, when a discourse adverbial
explicitly signalled a discourse relation, there was often a separate concurrent
relation that could be associated with an implicit coordinating or subordinating
conjunction.
</p>
<p>
There are different circumstances in which different sets of concurrent discourse
relations are taken to hold. I will go through these, and conclude with what I take
the implications of this to be for various language technologies, including statistical
machine translation.
</p>

<p>
<b>Bonnie Webber</b> is a Professor in the School of Informatics, at the the University of Edinburgh.
She moved there from the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, with which she continues
to maintain strong and frequent contact.
</p>
<p>
Known for her work on discourse anaphora and discourse connectives, she has served
as President of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL); co-editor (with
Annie Zaenen and Martha Palmer) of the electronic journal, "Linguistic Issues in Language
Technology", and co-developer (with Aravind Joshi, Rashmi Prasad, Alan Lee and
Eleni Miltsakaki) of the Penn Discourse TreeBank.
</p>
<p>
She is a Fellow of the American Association for Artificial Intelligence, the Royal Society
of Edinburgh, and the Association for Computational Linguistics. In the past few years,
she and her group have focussed on how computational understanding of discourse structure
and aspects of discourse coherence can be applied to improving the quality and accuracy
of Statistical Machine Translation.
