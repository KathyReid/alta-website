        <p> The <a href="https://alta2019.alta.asn.au/">
	          2019 Australasian Language Technology Association Workshop</a>
            (ALTA 2019) will be held from the 4th-6th of December at the
	          University of Technology Sydney, co-located with the Australasian Document
            Computing Symposium.

    <dd>
        <p> ALTA is seeking problems to use for the tenth ALTA Shared Task. The ALTA shared tasks are targeted at university students with programming experience.
        The problems that we are seeking should have the following features:

            <ul>
        <li>They are related to a language technology task.</li>
        <li>They should be easy to explain to undergraduate and Masters students with programming skills but without knowledge on language technology.</li>
        <li>The task should be of such a difficulty that it would encourage the participants to attempt the competition, yet it is possible to discriminate among the best submissions and pick a winner. In other words, it should be very hard to get perfect results (so that it is difficult to have ties) but simple methods should achieve encouraging results.</li>
        <li>It should be possible to evaluate the results automatically using an evaluation platform such as Kaggle in Class (https://inclass.kaggle.com)</li>
        <li>The training and test data can be distributed to the participants freely ("free" as for "freedom", and preferably with no or very small cost).</li>
        <li>The final test data should not be currently publicly available.</li>
        <li>And above all, the task should be fun!</li>
    </ul>
For any questions or to submit a proposal, please send an email to: share...@alta.asn.au

<h1>The Role of Research in Language Technology</h1>
<p>
The cutting-edge nature of Language Technology means that research is
particularly important:  there are many unsolved problems in the automated
processing of spoken and written language, and in many cases we have only
begun to scratch the surface.  Research in Language Technology, which for
our purposes covers a space that also includes Natural Language Processing
and Computational Linguistics, draws on work in a diverse array of
disciplines, including linguistics, psychology, philosophy and computer
science, and now, with the increasing role played by statistical methods,
also mathematics.
</p>

<h1>Research Activity in Australasia</h1>
<p>
Given the wide range of contributing disciplines, research in Language
Technology in Australia and New Zealand is carried out in many different
contexts.  The listing below provides pointers to clusters of activity that
involve more than one or two individual researchers.
