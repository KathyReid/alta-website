<h1>The Role of Research in Language Technology</h1>
<p>
The cutting-edge nature of Language Technology means that research is
particularly important:  there are many unsolved problems in the automated
processing of spoken and written language, and in many cases we have only
begun to scratch the surface.  Research in Language Technology, which for
our purposes covers a space that also includes Natural Language Processing
and Computational Linguistics, draws on work in a diverse array of
disciplines, including linguistics, psychology, philosophy and computer
science, and now, with the increasing role played by statistical methods,
also mathematics.
</p>

<h1>Research Activity in Australasia</h1>
<p>
Given the wide range of contributing disciplines, research in Language
Technology in Australia and New Zealand is carried out in many different
contexts.  The listing below provides pointers to clusters of activity that
involve more than one or two individual researchers.
