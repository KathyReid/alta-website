<h1>Mentoring at ALTA</h1>

<h2>What is Mentoring?</h2>
<p>Mentoring is generally considered to be a voluntary relationship that gives people the opportunity to share their skills, knowledge and experiences, both personal and professional.</p>

<h2>Three Key Benefits for the Mentor</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Improve interpersonal skills in counselling, listening, modelling, and leading</li>
    <li>Access to new perspectives, information, and knowledge</li>
    <li>Enhance professional relationships and networks</li>
</ul>

<h2>Three Key Benefits for the Mentee</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Receive valuable feedback from an experienced subject-matter expert</li>
    <li>Have opportunities to develop networks with experienced and positive role models</li>
    <li>Have a supportive envirnonment in which successes and failurtes can be evaluated in a non-confrontational manner and new ideas can be tested
    </li>
</ul>

<h2> How does it work?</h2>
<p>To initiate a mentoring session, a mentee should proactively organise a meeting with an ALTA mentor in advance during or after the ALTA workshop.</p>

<p>Step 1: Choose a mentor from the ALTA mentor list.</p>

<p>Step 2: Contact him/her via an email</p>

<p>Step 3: Organise a mentoring session either virtually (e.g., Zoom, Kumospace or Slack) or in person.</p>

<h2>Boundaries of the mentor relationship</h2> 
<p>Professional and ethical behaviour is expected at all times in a mentor relationship. A mentor and a mentee should treat the relationship with respect and maintain privacy/confidentiality of conversations. It is important that the mentee makes his/her own decisions and is responsible for his/her own actions.</p>
