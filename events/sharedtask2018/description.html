<h2>2018 Shared Task Description: Classifying Patent Applications</h2>

<h3>Basic Task Description</h3>

<p>When a patent application is submitted there is a process where
  the application is classified by examiners of patent offices or
  other people. Patent classifications make it feasible to search
  quickly for documents about earlier disclosures similar to or
  related to the invention for which a patent is applied for, and to
  track technological trends in patent applications.<p>

<p>The International Patent Classification (IPC) is agreed
  internationally. A patent can have several classification labels but
  there is one which is the primary label. This is what is called the
  primary IPC mark.</p>

<p>A label is of the form A01B 1/00, where each component has a
  special meaning:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A: Section symbol; a letter from A to H as follows:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>A: Human necessities</li>
    <li>B: Performing operations, transporting</li>
    <li>C: Chemistry, metallurgy</li>
    <li>D: Textiles, paper</li>
    <li>E: Fixed constructions</li>
    <li>F: Mechanical engineering, lighting, heating, weapons,
      blasting</li>
    <li>G: Physics</li>
    <li>H: Electricity</li>
  </ul>
  <li>01: Class; this is a two-digit number that represents a class
    within the section.
  <li>B: Subclass; this is an additional capital letter.
  <li>1/00: Group; each group symbol consists of the subclass symbol
  followed by two numbers separated by an oblique stroke.
</ul>

<p>For example, an application for a patent about lasers might have
  the following two IPC marks, where the first one is the primary IPC
  mark:</p>
<ul>
  <li>H01S 3/00 (Lasers)</li>
  <li>H01S 3/14 (Lasers characterised by the material used as the
  active medium)</li>
</ul>

<p>Some patent applications may refer to several sections of the IPC
  and this would be indicated by the presence of several IPC
  marks. For example, the following application would have a primary
  IPC mark about fittings for hats and an additional IPC mark for
  pyjamas:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A42C 5/00 (Fittings or trimmings for hats)</li>
  <li>A41D 10/00 (Pyjamas; Nightdresses)</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal of this task is to automatically classify Australian
  patents into one of the principal International Patent
  Classification sections. <strong>This is the first character (A to
  H) of the primary IPC mark.</strong>  We have downloaded nearly
  5,000 documents, of which we have reserved 1,000 documents for the
  evaluation of the systems.</p>

<h3>Evaluation</h3>

<p>
We will use Kaggle in Class to evaluate the systems.
</p>

<h3>Data Files and Submission</h3>

<a>We will use <a href="http://inclass.kaggle.com">Kaggle in Class</a>
for this year's competition (look for
the <a href="https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/alta-2018-challenge">ALTA
2018 Challenge</a>). The data files and submission instructions will
be provided in the competition website.</a>

<p>In order to access the Kaggle in Class pages, you need
to <a href="index.html#register">register with this shared
task</a>.</p>
