      <h1>Getting there</h1>

<p>
The ALTA 2005 Workshop and Tutorials will all be held in the Madsen
Building (F09), which is the current home of the School of Information
Technologies, University of Sydney. There is more information about
SIT available <a
href="http://www.it.usyd.edu.au/about/index.shtml">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
The Madsen Building is the first building on your left as you come
into the university through the City Road entrance. Madsen building
has some interesting history too, originally housing the CSIRO's
National Measurement Laboratory, which build Australia's first
computer, CSIRAC.
</p>

<p>
There is a large online map available <a
href="http://db.auth.usyd.edu.au/directories/map/largemap00a.html">here</a>.
The Madsen Building is located at L17 and Women's College is located
at P11 on this map. It is a very pleasant 10 minute walk through the
university (along Physics Road) to get between Madsen and Women's
College.
</p>

<p>
Since parking space is very limited, I recommend public transport for
attendees in the Sydney area. The closest train station is Redfern but
it is not recommended you walk to Redfern in the evening. Sydney
University runs a security bus to and from Redfern station quite
frequently. See <a
href="http://www.usyd.edu.au/stuserv/getting_around/security.shtml">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
The other option is Central station and then catching a bus (or a
15-20 minute walk) to Sydney University. The buses leave from Railway
square and any bus numbered 42X will head towards Sydney University
along City Road.  The City Road entrance is just after a footbridge
which crosses City Road.  Many of the other 4XX buses travel past
Sydney university, but not on the City Road side.
</p>

<p>
The STA has a travel route map for getting to the University,
available from <a
href="http://www.sta.nsw.gov.au/commonpdfs/sta/bus/map/uniofsydneypmttard-30July04.pdf">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
There is some on campus parking but it is heavily over subscribed
so it will be hard to find a space during the tutorials on Friday.
The weekend is not so problematic. The cost of parking is $6 a
day on weekends.  More information is available <a
href="http://www.usyd.edu.au/stuserv/getting_around/parking/index.shtml">here</a>.
