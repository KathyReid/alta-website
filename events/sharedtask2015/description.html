<h2>2015 Shared Task Description</h2>

<h3>Introduction to Cognates</h3>

<p>Cognates words are pairs words that are similar in
spelling/pronunciation as well as meaning in two languages. By
extension, we refer here to cognates as words in one language that
would, in their context of use, acceptably translate into a word in
the second language with which they would form a cognate pair.  We
also refer here to true cognates as per this definition, as opposed to
false cognates (also referred to as false friends) which appear in
both languages' lexicons but bear different meanings (such
as <em>pain</em> in English and <em>pain</em> in French (bread)), and
as opposed to semi-cognates, which, depending on their context of use,
may be either true cognates or false cognates (such as <em>chair</em>
in English that translates into French as <em>chaise</em> if one
refers to furniture (false cognate) as <em>chaire</em> if one refers
to a University position (true cognate), while <em>chair</em> in
French means <em>flesh</em> in English (false cognate)).</p>

<h3>Task Motivation</h3>

<p>When native speakers of one of the languages are learning the other
languages, cognates are very easy to understand. Therefore, being able
to detect in texts in a target language all the words that are
cognates from the perspective of a native language can have many
applications for computer assisted second language education.  This
task is in contrast to many experimental settings in the literature
that focused on detecting pairs of cognates amongst pairs of words in
both languages. </p>

<h3>Task Description</h3>

<p>
The aim of the task is to identify in English texts all the cognates
from the perspective of the French language. In other words, identify
all the words in the English text that would acceptably translate into
a similar word in French.</p>

<p>
Participants are provided with a training set that is approximately
the same size as the test set. Each set is composed of 30
documents, 5 in each of the following genres: novel, subtitles, sports
news, political news, technology news, and cooking recipes. While the
separations between the documents will be included in both the
training and testing data, the categories of documents will only be
released after submission of results, to allow to be taken into
account in detailed results analysis, but not as input to the test
data.
</p>

<p>A single annotator has manually annotated the texts. See below
explanations on these categories and rules of the manual
annotation.</p>

<p>
The texts are presented a data file with one word (and punctuation
attached if present) per line preceded by the line number and a space,
and each document is preceded by a line with the document id. Here is
an example of the beginning of the document format:
</p>

<pre>
1 &lt;docid 1&gt;
2 Chewy
3 little
4 drops
5 of
6 chocolate
7 cookies,
8 covered
9 with
10 peanuts
</pre>

<p>The annotations for the training set are provided in a separate
.csv file, where the first line with id 1 contains the ids of the sure
cognates only, and the second line with id 2 contains the ids of both
borderline and sure cognates. The .csv for the example above would
then be:</p>

<pre>
Eval_id,Cognates_id
1, 6 7
</pre>

<p>This file indicates that the words with ID 6 (<em>chocolate</em>)
and 7 (<em>cookies</em>) are cognates.</p>

<p>This is also the format for submission.</p>


<h3>Evaluation</h3>

<p>
We will use Kaggle in Class to evaluate the systems using the average
F1-measure among all documents.
</p>

<h3>Data Files and Submission</h3>

<a>We will use <a href="http://inclass.kaggle.com">Kaggle in Class</a>
for this year's competition (look for
the <a href="https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/alta-2015-challenge">ALTA
2015 Challenge</a>). The data files and submission instructions will
be provided in the competition website.</a>
