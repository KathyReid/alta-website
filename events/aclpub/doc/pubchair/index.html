<h2>ACLPUB HOWTO: A Guide for the Publications Chair of an ACL-Affiliated Conference</h2>

<p>Much more is coming on this webpage about how to do your job.
(Please edit this webpage yourself and check it back in to CVS!)</p>

<p>This is just a quick stub explaining how to use the software.
Start with the other HOWTO document, which is aimed at book chairs.
You yourself will typically be the book chair for the main
proceedings.  Other volumes will typically be assembled by their
program chairs and sent to you.</p>

<p>In the end, you will receive a bunch of <code>proceedings</code>
directories from the different book chairs, including yourself.</p>

<p>Now switch to your role as publications chair to put everything
together.  Create a master working directory somewhere, perhaps called
<code>conference</code>.  You will do all your work as pub chair in
this directory.</p>

<p><i>Copy</i> the file <code>.../aclpub/make/Makefile_pubchair</code>
to <code>.../conference/Makefile</code>.</p>

<p>Create a directory <code>.../conference/books</code> and unpack
each of the <code>proceedings</code> directories under it.  Of course
you will have to rename the <code>proceedings</code> directories so
that they don't all have the same name: e.g,
<code>.../conference/books/main</code>, <code>.../conference/books/w01-discourse</code>,
<code>.../conference/books/w02-conll</code>, etc.</p>

<p>Now here are the main things to build in the
<code>conference</code> directory.  All 5 of the following will be
made if you type <code>make all</code>.</p>
<blockquote><pre>
make print     <i># then try "make print.zip" to package up the results</i>
make cdrom     <i># then try "make cdrom-web" to put the results on a web server for proofreading by others</i>
make anthology <i># then try "make anthology-web" or "make anthology.tgz"</i>
make advertisements
make copyright-signatures
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, some of the CD-ROM templates (HTML files in
<code>aclpub/templates</code>) still hardcode stuff from ACL 2005.
This will eventually be corrected through use of the <code>meta</code>
file, but for now, your best bet is to edit the <i>templates</i> to
your liking and remake.</p>

<p>There are a number of other things I'm planning to improve.  The most
important is to support hand-editing of automatically generated files,
in such a way that the edits are preserved if the file is
automatically regenerated.</p>

<p>You should improve this document yourself, to pass on your
experience to future chairs.  Please contact Jason Eisner for a
CVS username and password.  Then you can modify your copy of
<code>aclpub</code> and check the changes back into the CVS
repository as follows:
<blockquote><pre>
<i># put this in your .bashrc or .cshrc file</i>
export CVSROOT=:pserver:<i>USERNAME</i>@ftp.clsp.jhu.edu/aclpub <i># bash</i>
setenv CVSROOT :pserver:<i>USERNAME</i>@ftp.clsp.jhu.edu/aclpub <i># csh</i>

<i># only have to do this once on a given machine</i>
cvs login     <i># now type your password</i>

<i># check in your changes</i>
cd .../aclpub
cvs update
cvs commit
</pre></blockquote>

<p>If you don't want to set <code>CVSROOT</code>, you could
try it this way:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
alias aclcvs='cd ~/aclpub; cvs -d :pserver:<i>USERNAME</i>@ftp.clsp.jhu.edu:/aclpub'
aclcvs <i>COMMAND</i>    <i># instead of cvs COMMAND</i>
</pre></blockquote>
