No, but naturally Philipp asked Omnipress to price out that option
before we discussed it with everyone else.  That's why it's in the
document.  But the discussion seemed to bring up more worries than
enthusiasm, so we're going to stick to the tried-and-true format.

(Philipp has also replied.)

Hi Drago,

this is not exactly right. The proposal has both options listed
-- the 800 page / 500 copies option for $9,790 and the
80 page / 50 copies option for $755.

I guess the current state of discussion is to go with one
proceeding per workshop.

Costs then depends on how many workshops
actually take place, how many attendants per workshop, how many
pages per workshop. But as I stated earlier the cost for
workshop proceedings will be pretty much number_of_workshops times $755.

Greetings,
Philipp

 Hi Jason,

I appreciate your thoughts.

1) Yes, the per unit price on the 800 page, 500 quantity 
[was miscalculated and is not $9.79 but] $19.58. 

2) Regarding the 500 quantity for the combined Workshop Proceedings, just
let me know what looks realistic and I can revise it.  That quantity was
used just as a rough idea for conceptual planning.

3) An 800 page book will weigh roughly 4 pounds.

4) I like the idea of putting combining the Workshop Proceedings into 2
volumes with different quantities.  I can work up pricing for this option.
Please share the estimate quantity for the 500 and the 300 page books.

5) Looking at the Spring 2004 HLT-NAACL Workshops with 8 books, the
average is 102 pages.

6) Now if I shared our magic formula you wouldn't need me! :)  Actually,
there is a lot that goes into the entire price so it is not easy or
possible to share any type of formula.  So you can just let me know the
specifications and I'll do the work for you.

Thank you Jason!

Best Regards,

Jodi
