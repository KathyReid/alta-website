Below is the format to use for a very simple flat author/title 
database that can be used by perl scripts to generate multiple
tables of content and indexes, both for the hard-copy proceedings
and the CDROM.

Using a standard database for everything can save time and
reduce typographical errors.


EXAMPLE OF DATABASE ENTRY (MORE EXAMPLES BELOW):
-----------------------------------------------

  P: 1
  T: Headline Generation Based on Statistical Translation 
  A: Banko, Michele
  A: Mittal, Vibhu O.
  A: Witbrock, Michael J.
  H: 12:10-12:30
  F: banko.pdf
  L: 8


FORMAT FOR TITLE/AUTHOR DATABASE:
--------------------------------

P or ID: Paper ID Number - REQUIRED
    The ID number assigned in the reviewing process.

T: Title (in desired case).   REQUIRED
       - Include \\ if/where linebreak is needed.

A: Author (family name, personal name(s))   
      - list in order given on paper
      - Do not include \\ for linebreaks. Direct editing is necessary for 
            cases of long author lists with strange linebreaks.
      - at least 1 required

H: Hours of presentation (for inclusion on program) - OPTIONAL
        For example,    H: 11:30-11:50

F: PDF Filename for inclusion on CDROM - OPTIONAL NOW, REQUIRED BY SEPT 8.
     (This is the actual PDF filename for each paper on the CDROM.
       We *need* this information to create a correct index for
        the CDROM. This is the major reason why we need a database
        created in this format.)
    The last name of the first author is suggested (e.g. banko.pdf),
    with numbers to distinguish names with multiple occurrences
    (e.g. chen.pdf, chen2.pdf, chen3.pdf). 

L: Paper Length (in pages) - REQUIRED

     (do not give the starting pages - this will be computed
      automatically by summing up paper lengths.)

SP: Starting Page Number - OPTIONAL and NOT CURRENTLY SUPPORTED

    This is computed automatically from the sum of paper lengths,
    but may be worth including as a sanity check

I: Institution - OPTIONAL and NOT CURRENTLY SUPPORTED

     If you wish to add a person's institution to any of the
     output files then you will need to modify the Perl programs
     to accommodate this field.

C: Copyright Signature - OPTIONAL

     When generated from START data, this entry will contain
     the signature of the submitter when approving the release
     of the copyright.

M: Offset - OPTIONAL

     Correction to the position of the paper when included in the
     proceedings. The changes are x-axis change and y-axis change
     in millimeter. The x-axis change is not implemented.

X: Additional Program Information

     This is not part of a paper record, but has to be placed
     in a separate block. 

Please separate papers by a single blank line.
