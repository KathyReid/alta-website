See the README file in the parent directory for general information.

This is the doc subdirectory for the aclpub package.
It contains information for three types of people:

* The publications chair, who is responsible for coordinating all
  publishing activities for a conference and its associated
  workshops.  Usually this consists of many "books," one for each
  of the following:

  1. main conference
  2. student session
  3. session for short papers, posters, and/or demos
  4. tutorial abstracts
  5. EACH co-located workshop or conference

  The books must be printed, turned into a CD-ROM, delivered to
  the ACL Anthology, etc.

* A book chair -- e.g., the program chair of a single workshop, who is
  responsible for producing and proofreading the book for that
  workshop.

  Each book contains various front matter (including a program), a
  collection of papers, and an index.  It is produced in print and
  electronic formats using the aclpub package.  The relevant files are
  then sent to the publications chair.

* An individual author, who must submit camera-ready copy for an
  accepted paper.  An author is not expected to use the aclpub
  package, but he or she must be instructed on how to make
  an appropriate PDF file and submit it to the book chair.
