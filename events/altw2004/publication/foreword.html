<h1>Electronic Proceedings</h1>
<h2>Foreword</h2>

<p>
ALTW 2004 is the second workshop organised by the recently founded
Australasian Language Technology Association (ALTA), following previous
Australasian Natural Language Processing Workshops. The first
Australasian Natural Language Processing Workshop was held at Macquarie
University, in 2001 and the second in Canberra in 2002. The first ALTW
was held in Melbourne in 2003, in conjunction with a Summer School in
Language Technology (ALTSS). ALTW is now ALTA's annual meeting. This
year, ALTW and the Summer School in Language Technology are being held
in conjunction with the Tenth Australian International Conference on
Speech Science & Technology (SST 2004).
</p>

<p>
Every year, the number of submissions (including submissions from
overseas) increases significantly, indicating both the growth of the
research area in Australasia and the higher international visibility of
the workshop. As a result, every year the standard of the workshop also
increases. This year, as in previous years, each submission was a full
paper and was reviewed by at least two members of an international
programme committee of leading researchers in language technology,
listed on the next page. We would like to thank the programme committee
for their dedicated and careful review of the papers. The call for
papers for ALTW solicited papers presenting substantial, original and
unpublished research on all aspects of language technology. We have
selected 22 papers for the workshop, which is organised in two parallel
sessions.
</p>

<p>
We would like to thank the local organisers of ALTW/ALTSS and SST for
their help in organising this workshop, in particular Diego Molla and
Steve Cassidy. We would also like to thank the ALTA executive committee
for assistance in various respects. Finally, we would like to thank the
sponsors (DSTO, Appen, and VeCommerce) for their generous help in 
supporting the workshop, and Dominique Estival as the sponsorship coordinator.
</p>

<p>
As a final word, we hope you will all enjoy the workshop. We are very
excited to see `that the language technology community in Australia and
the region is vibrant and growing. We hope the workshop will once again
foster interactions amongst researchers in language technology research.
