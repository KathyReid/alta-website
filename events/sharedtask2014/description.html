<h2>2014 Shared Task Description</h2>

<h3>Basic Task Description</h3>

<p>The goal of this task is to identify all mentions of locations in the
text of tweets. Location is any specific mention of a country, city,
suburb, street, or POI (Point of Interest). A POI can be the name of a
shopping centre, such as "Macquarie Centre" or name of a hospital, e.g.,
"Ryde Hospital". This is an information extraction task important for
applications that want to find out where people are or they are talking
about which location. This task requires you to only identify which word
in the text of a tweet refers to a location, and does not expect you to
find the location on the map. For example, in the tweets:</p>

<ol>
<li> "France and Germany join the US and UK in advising their nationals in Libya to leave immediately http://bbc.in/1rVmrDJ"</li>

<li>"Dutch investigators not going to MH17 crash site in eastern Ukraine due to security concerns, OSCE monitors say"</li>

<li>"Seeing early signs of potential flash flooding with stationary storms near St. Marys, Tavistock, Cambridge #onstorm pic.twitter.com/BtogIxgQ5G"</li>
</li>
</ol>

<p>locations are:</p>

<ol>
<li>France, Germany, US, UK, Libya</li>
<li>MH17 crash site, eastern Ukraine</li>
<li>St. Marys, Tavistock, Cambridge</li>
</ol>

<p>Locations can be in the text itself, or in hashtags (e.g, #australia),
URLs, or sometimes even in mentions (e.g., @australia).  As location mentions can
span over words, all these words must be identified, however, partial
identification of location names will be rewarded too. For example if
from "eastern Ukraine" your system only identifies "Ukraine", it will be
half correct.</p>

<p>
You will be given a list of tweet-ids and a script to help you download
the tweets from Twitter. If a tweet is deleted by its author, it will
not be retrieved. Your system should find the location mentions, and list
them all in lowercase as blank separated words next to their tweet-id.
For example, 
<p>

<pre>
Input id
493450763931512832
</pre>

<p>retrieves</p>
<pre>
author: BBCBreaking
tweet text: France and Germany join the US and UK in advising their nationals in Libya to leave immediately http://bbc.in/1rVmrDJ
</pre>

<p>and your output should be:</p>

<pre>
493450763931512832,france germany us uk libya
</pre>

<p>All punctuation in the word containing the location must be
removed, including the hash symbol (#).</p>

<p>If a locations is repeated in a tweet, you need to number them from the second occurrence. For
example, if there are three mentions of Australia, then you will have</p>

<pre>
australia australia2 australia3
</pre>

<p>
If a location has multiple words, separate them with blank space so that, in effect, it does not matter whether it is one location expression with two words or two different location expressions. Thus, if a tweet with ID "1234" has two location expressions "London" and "United States" the following are valid and equivalent descriptions:
</p>

<pre>
1234,london united states
1234,united london states
</pre>

<p>
If a tweet does not have any location mention, then use the marker <code>NONE</code>.
<p>

<h3>Evaluation</h3>

<p>
We will use Kaggle in Class to evaluate the systems using F-measure on the word level. 
</p>

<h3>Data Files and Submission</h3>

<a>We will use <a href="http://inclass.kaggle.com">Kaggle in Class</a>
for this year's competition (look for
the <a href="https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/alta-2014-challenge">ALTA
2014 Challenge</a>). The data files and submission instructions will
be provided in the competition website.</a>

<p>There is a training set and a test set. The training set contains
2000 tweets sorted in time, together with the location mentions. The
format of this file is exactly the same as the format of the
submission file. The test set contains just over 1000 tweets sorted in
time, this time without the location mentions. Your task is to find
the location mentions of this test set and submit the results to
Kaggle in Class. The timestamp of the tweets of the test set are after
those of the training set, to model a realistic scenario where we
train on known tweets and we want to predict the location mentions in
future tweets.</p>
