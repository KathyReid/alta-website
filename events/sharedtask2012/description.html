<h2>2012 Shared Task Description</h2>

<h3>Basic Task Description</h3>

<p>July 18, 2012 | Version 1</p>

<p> The goal of this task is to build automatic sentence classifiers
that can map the content of biomedical abstracts into a set of
pre-defined categories, which are used for Evidence-Based Medicine
(EBM). EBM practitioners rely on specific criteria when judging
whether a scientific article is relevant to a given question. They
generally follow the PICO criterion: Population (P) (i.e.,
participants in a study); Intervention (I); Comparison (C) (if
appropriate); and Outcome (O) (of an Intervention). Variations and
extensions of this classification have been proposed, and for this
task we will extend PICO by adding the classes Background (B) and
Study Design (S); and including sentences that have no relevant
content: Other (O). Therefore, the goal will be to classify the
provided sentences according to the PIBOSO schema. Such information
could be leveraged in various ways: e.g., to improve search
performance; to enable structured querying with specific categories;
and to aid users in more quickly making judgements against specified
PICOSO criteria. </p>

<p> In order to build classifiers, 800 expert-annotated training
abstracts will be provided, and the goal will be to build classifiers
to annotate 200 test abstracts with the relevant labels. This is a
multi-label classification problem, since each sentence can have more
than one label. The tagset is defined as follows: </p>

<ul>
        <li> Background: Material that informs and may place the current study in perspective, e.g. work that preceded the current; information about disease prevalence; etc; </li>

	<li> Population: The group of individual persons, objects, or items comprising the study's sample, or from which the sample was taken for statistical measurement; </li>

	<li> Intervention: The act of interfering with a condition to modify it or with a process to change its course (includes prevention); </li>

	<li> Outcome: The sentence(s) that best summarise(s) the consequences of an intervention; </li>

	<li> Study Design: The type of study that is described in the abstract; </li>

	<li> Other: Any sentence not falling into one of the other categories and presumed to provide little help with clinical decision making, i.e. non-key or irrelevant sentences. </li>

</ul>

<p> More information about this problem, the construction of the dataset,
and a benchmark can be found
in <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/12/S2/S5" target="_blank">Kim et al. (2011)</a> </p>


<h3>Data Files and Submission</h3>

We will use <a href="http://inclass.kaggle.com">Kaggle in Class</a>
for this year's competition (look for
the <a href="http://www.kaggle.com/c/alta-nicta-challenge2">ALTA-NICTA
Challenge</a>). The details about data formats and the submission will
be provided in the competition website.
