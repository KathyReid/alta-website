<h3>Chris Brockett (Microsoft Research)</h3>

<p>Diverse Words, Shared Meanings: Statistical Machine Translation for Paraphrase, Grounding, and Intent</p>

<p>Can two different descriptions refer to the same event or action?
Recognising that dissimilar strings are equivalent in meaning for some
purpose is something that humans do rather well, but it is a task at
which machines often fail. In the Natural Language Processing Group at
Microsoft Research, we are attempting to address this challenge at
sentence scale by generating semantically equivalent rewrites that can
be used in applications ranging from authoring assistance to intent
mapping for search or command and control.  The Microsoft Translator
paraphrase engine, developed in the NLP group, is a large-scale
phrasal machine translation system that generates short sentential and
phrasal paraphrases in English and has a public API that is available
to researchers and developers. I will present the data extraction
process, architecture, issues in generating diverse outputs,
applications and possible future directions, and discuss the strengths
and limitations of the statistical machine translation model as it
relates to paraphrasing, how paraphrase is like machine translation,
and how it differs in important respects. The statistical machine
translation approach also has broad applications in capturing user
intent in search, conversational understanding, and the grounding of
language in objects and actions, all active areas of investigation in
Microsoft Research.</p>


<h3>Jen Hay (University of Canterbury)</h3>

<p>Using a large annotated historical corpus to study word-specific effects in sound change</p>

<p>
The Origins of New Zealand English Corpora (ONZE) at the University of
Canterbury contain recordings spanning 150 years of New Zealand
English.  These have all been force-aligned at the phoneme-level, and
are stored with many layers of annotation some which have been
automatically generated, and some which have been manually annotated.
We interact with the corpus via our custom LaBB-CAT interface
(LAnguage, Brain and Behaviour Corpus Analysis Tool).  I will
begin the talk by describing and demonstrating the corpus, and its
associated LaBB-CAT tool.  I will then focus on one particular recent
study which has used the corpus, which aims to understand processes of
sound change.</p>

<p>The combination of the time-depth of the ONZE collection, and the
degree of careful annotation it contains, makes it an ideal data-set
for the study of mechanisms underlying sound change.  In particular,
we aim to address the question which has been the subject of
long-standing debate in the sound-change literature do sound changes
proceed uniformly through the lexicon, or are there word-specific
changes, with some words more ahead in the change than others?  I
describe a study which aimed to investigate this question by focusing
on the mechanisms underpinning the New Zealand English front short
vowel shift, of the vowels in words like bat, bet and bit.  We
automatically extracted formant values for over 100,000 tokens of
words containing these vowels, We show that this data contains good
evidence for word-specific effects in sound change, and argue that
these are predicted by current models of speech production and
perception, in combination with well-established psycholinguistic
processes.</p>
